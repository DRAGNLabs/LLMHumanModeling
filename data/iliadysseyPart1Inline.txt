Rage—Goddess, sing the rage of Peleus' son Achilles, murderous, doomed, that cost the Achaeans countless losses, hurling down to the House of Death so many sturdy souls, great fighters' souls, but made their bodies carrion, feasts for the dogs and birds, and the will of Zeus was moving toward its end. Begin, Muse, when the two first broke and clashed, Agamemnon lord of men and brilliant Achilles. What god drove them to fight with such a fury? Apollo the son of Zeus and Leto. Incensed at the king he swept a fatal plague through the army—men were dying and all because Agamemnon spurned Apollo's priest. Yes, Chryses approached the Achaeans' fast ships to win his daughter back, bringing a priceless ransom and bearing high in hand, wound on a golden staff, the wreaths of the god, the distant deadly Archer. He begged the whole Achaean army but most of all the two supreme commanders, Atreus' two sons, "Agamemnon, Menelaus—all Argives geared for war! May the gods who hold the halls of Olympus give you Priam's city to plunder, then safe passage home. Just set my daughter free, my dear one . . . here, accept these gifts, this ransom. Honor the god who strikes from worlds away‑the son of Zeus, Apollo!" And all ranks of Achaeans cried out their assent: "Respect the priest, accept the shining ransom!" But it brought no joy to the heart of Agamemnon. The king dismissed the priest with a brutal order ringing in his ears: "Never again, old man, let me catch sight of you by the hollow shipsl Not loitering now, not slinking back tomorrow. The staff and the wreaths of god will never save you then. The girl—I won't give up the girl. Long before that, old age will overtake her in my house, in Argos, far from her fatherland, slaving back and forth at the loom, forced to share my bed! Now go, don't tempt my wrath‑and you may depart alive." The old man was terrified. He obeyed the order, turning, trailing away in silence down the shore where the battle lines of breakers crash and drag. And moving off to a safe distance, over and over the old priest prayed to the son of sleek‑haired Leto, lord Apollo, "Hear me, Apollo! God of the silver bow who strides the walls of Chryse and Cilla sacrosanct— ­lord in power of Tenedos—Smintheus, god of the plague! If I ever roofed a shrine to please your heart, ever burned the long rich bones of bulls and goats on your holy altar, now, now bring my prayer to pass. Pay the Danaans back‑your arrows for my tears!" His prayer went up and Phoebus Apollo heard him. Down he strode from Olympus' peaks, storming at heart with his bow and hooded quiver slung across his shoulders. The arrows clanged at his back as the god quaked with rage, the god himself on the march and down he came like night. Over against the ships he dropped to a knee, let fly a shaft and a terrifying clash rang out from the great silver bow. First he went for the mules and circling dogs but then, launching a piercing shaft at the men themselves, he cut them down in droves— and the corpse‑fires burned on, night and day, no end in sight. Nine days the arrows of god swept through the army. On the tenth Achilles called all ranks to muster— the impulse seized him, sent by white‑armed Hera grieving to see Achaean fighters drop and die. Once they'd gathered, crowding the meeting grounds, the swift runner Achilles rose and spoke among them: "Son of Atreus, now we are beaten back, I fear, the long campaign is lost. So home we sail . . . if we can escape our death—if war and plague are joining forces now to crush the Argives. But wait: let us question a holy man, a prophet, even a man skilled with dreams— dreams as well can come our way from Zeus— come, someone to tell us why Apollo rages so, whether he blames us for a vow we failed, or sacrifice. If only the god would share the smoky savor of lambs and full‑grown goats, Apollo might be willing, still, somehow, to save us from this plague." So he proposed and down he sat again as Calchas rose among them, Thestor's son, the clearest by far of all the seers who scan the flight of birds. He knew all things that are, all things that are past and all that are to come, the seer who had led the Argive ships to Troy with the second sight that god Apollo gave him. For the armies' good the seer began to speak: "Achilles, dear to Zeus . . . you order me to explain Apollo's anger, the distant deadly Archer? I will tell it all: But strike a pact with me, swear you will defend me with all your heart, with words and strength of hand. For there is a man I will enrage—I see it now— ­a powerful man who lords it over all the Argives, one the Achaeans must obey . . . A mighty king, raging against an inferior, is too strong. Even if he can swallow down his wrath today, still he will nurse the burning in his chest until, sooner or later, he sends it bursting forth. Consider it closely, Achilles. Will you save me?" And the matchless runner reassured him: "Courage! Out with it now, Calchas. Reveal the will of god, whatever you may know. And I swear by Apollo dear to Zeus, the power you pray to, Calchas, when you reveal god's will to the Argives—no one, not while I am alive and see the light on earth, no one will lay his heavy hands on you by the hollow ships. None among all the armies. Not even if you mean Agamemnon here who now claims to be, by far, the best of the Achaeans." The seer took heart and this time he spoke out, bravely: "Beware­— he casts no blame for a vow we failed, a sacrifice. The god's enraged because Agamemnon spurned his priest, he refused to free his daughter, he refused the ransom. That's why the Archer sends us pains and he will send us more and never drive this shameful destruction from the Argives, not till we give back the girl with sparkling eyes to her loving father‑no price, no ransom paid— and carry a sacred hundred bulls to Chryse town. Then we can calm the god, and only then appease him." So he declared and sat down. But among them rose the fighting son of Atreus, lord of the far‑flung kingdoms, Agamemnon—furious, his dark heart filled to the brim, blazing with anger now, his eyes‑like searing fire. With a sudden, killing look he wheeled on Calchas first: "Seer of misery! Never a word that works to my advantage! Always misery warms your heart, your prophecies— never a word of profit said or brought to pass. Now, again, you divine god's will for the armies, bruit it about, as fact, why the deadly Archer multiplies our pains: because I, I refused that glittering price for the young girl Chryseis. Indeed, I prefer her by far, the girl herself, I want her mine in my own house! I rank her higher than Clytemnestra, my wedded wife—she's nothing less in build or breeding, in mind or works of hand. But I am willing to give her back, even so, if that is best for all. What I really want is to keep my people safe, not see them dying. But fetch me another prize, and straight off too, else I alone of the Argives go without my honor. That would be a disgrace: You are all witness, look‑my prize is snatched away!" But the swift runner Achilles answered him at once, "Just how, Agamemnon, great field marshal . . . most grasping man alive, how can the generous Argives give you prizes now? I know of no troves of treasure, piled, lying idle, anywhere. Whatever we dragged from towns we plundered, all's been portioned out. But collect it, call it back from the rank and file? That would be the disgrace. So return the girl to the god, at least for now. We Achaeans will pay you back, three, four times over, if Zeus will grant us the gift, somehow, someday; to raze Troy's massive ramparts to the ground." But King Agamemnon countered, "Not so quickly, brave as you are, godlike Achilles‑trying to cheat me. Oh no, you won't get past me, take me in that way! What do you want? To cling to your own prize while I sit calmly by‑empty‑handed here? Is that why you order me to give her back? No – if our generous Argives will give me a prize, a match for my desires, equal to what I've lost, well and good. But if they give me nothing I will take a prize myself‑your own, or Ajax' or Odysseus' prize‑I'll commandeer her myself and let that man I go to visit choke with rage! Enough. We'll deal with all this later, in due time. Now come, we haul a black ship down to the bright sea, gather a decent number of oarsmen along her locks and put aboard a sacrifice, and Chryseis herself, in all her beauty . . . we embark her too. Let one of the leading captains take command. Ajax, Idomeneus, trusty Odysseus or you, Achilles, you—the most violent man alive ‑so you can perform the rites for us and calm the god yourself." A dark glance and the headstrong runner answered him in kind: "Shameless —­ armored in shamelessness‑always shrewd with greed! How could any Argive soldier obey your orders, freely and gladly do your sailing for you or fight your enemies, full force? Not I, no. It wasn't Trojan spearmen who brought me here to fight. The Trojans never did me damage, not in the least, they never stole my cattle or my horses, never in Phthia where the rich soil breeds strong men did they lay waste my crops. How could they? Look at the endless miles that lie between us . . . shadowy mountain ranges, seas that surge and thunder. No, you colossal, shameless‑we all followed you, to please you, to fight for you, to win your honor back from the Trojans—Menelaus and you, you dog‑face! What do you care? Nothing. You don't look right or left. And now you threaten to strip me of my prize in person— the one I fought for long and hard, and sons of Achaea handed her to me. My honors never equal yours, whenever we sack some wealthy Trojan stronghold­— my arms bear the brunt of the raw, savage fighting, true, but when it comes to dividing up the plunder the lion's share is yours, and back I go to my ships, clutching some scrap, some pittance that I love, when I have fought to exhaustion. No more now­— back I go to Phthia. Better that way by far, to journey home in the beaked ships of war. I have no mind to linger here disgraced, brimming your cup and piling up your plunder." But the lord of men Agamemnon shot back, "Desert, by all means—if the spirit drives you home! I will never beg you to stay, not on my account. Never—others will take my side and do me honor, Zeus above all, whose wisdom rules the world. You—I hate you most of all the warlords loved by the gods. Always dear to your heart, strife, yes, and battles, the bloody grind of war. What if you are a great soldier? That's just a gift of god. Go home with your ships and comrades, lord it over your Myrmidons! You are nothing to me‑you and your overweening anger! But let this be my warning on your way: since Apollo insists on taking my Chryseis, I'll send her back in my own ships with my crew. But I, I will be there in person at your tents to take Briseis in all her beauty, your own prize— so you can learn just how much greater I am than you and the next man up may shrink from matching words with me, from hoping to rival Agamemnon strength for strength!" He broke off and anguish gripped Achilles. The heart in his tugged chest was pounding, torn . . . Should he draw the long sharp sword slung at his hip, thrust through the ranks and kill Agamemnon now?— or check his rage and beat his fury down? As his racing spirit veered back and forth, just as he drew his huge blade from its sheath, down from the vaulting heavens swept Athena, the white‑armed goddess Hera sped her down: Hera loved both men and cared for both alike. Rearing behind him Pallas seized his fiery hair— only Achilles saw her, none of the other fighters struck with wonder he spun around, he knew her at once, Pallas Athena! the terrible blazing of those eyes, and his winged words went flying: "Why, why now? Child of Zeus with the shield of thunder, why come now? To witness the outrage Agamemnon just committed? I tell you this, and so help me it's the truth— he'll soon pay for his arrogance with his life!" Her gray eyes clear, the goddess Athena answered, "Down from the skies I come to check your rage if only you will yield. The white‑armed goddess Hera sped me down: she loves you both, she cares for you both alike. Stop this fighting, now. Don't lay hand to sword. Lash him with threats of the price that he will face. And I tell you this‑and I know it is the truth­ — one day glittering gifts will lie before you, three times over to pay for all his outrage. Hold back now. Obey us both." So she urged and the swift runner complied at once: "I must— when the two of you hand down commands, Goddess, a man submits though his heart breaks with fury. Better for him by far. If a man obeys the gods they're quick to hear his prayers." And with that Achilles stayed his burly hand on the silver hilt and slid the huge blade back in its sheath. He would not fight the orders of Athena. Soaring home to Olympus, she rejoined the gods aloft in the halls of Zeus whose shield is thunder. But Achilles rounded on Agamemnon once again, lashing out at him, not relaxing his anger for a moment: "Staggering drunk, with your dog's eyes, your fawn's heart! Never once did you arm with the troops and go to battle or risk an ambush packed with Achaea's picked men— ­you lack the courage, you can see death coming. Safer by far, you find, to foray all through camp, commandeering the prize of any man who speaks against you. King who devours his people! Worthless husks, the men you rule— if not, Atrides, this outrage would have been your last. I tell you this, and I swear a mighty oath upon it . . . by this, this scepter, look, that never again will put forth crown and branches, now it's left its stump on the mountain ridge forever, nor will it sprout new green again, now the brazen ax has stripped its bark and leaves, and now the sons of Achaea pass it back and forth as they hand their judgments down, upholding the honored customs whenever Zeus commands — ­This scepter will be the mighty force behind my oath: someday, I swear, a yearning for Achilles will strike Achaea's sons and all your armies! But then, Atrides, harrowed as you will be, nothing you do can save you— not when your hordes of fighters drop and die, cut down by the hands of man‑killing Hector! Then— ­then you will tear your heart out, desperate, raging that you disgraced the best of the Achaeans!" Down on the ground he dashed the scepter studded bright with golden nails, then took his seat again. The son of Atreus smoldered, glaring across at him, but Nestor rose between them, the man of winning words, the clear speaker of Pylos . . . Sweeter than honey from his tongue the voice flowed on and on. Two generations of mortal men he had seen go down by now, those who were born and bred with him in the old days, in Pylos' holy realm, and now he ruled the third. He pleaded with both kings, with clear good will, "No more—or enormous sorrow comes to all Achaea! How they would exult, Priam and Priam's sons and all the Trojans. Oh they'd leap for joy to hear the two of you battling on this way, you who excel us all, first in Achaean councils, first in the ways of war. Stop. Please. Listen to Nestor. You are both younger than I, and in my time I struck up with better men than you, even you, but never once did they make light of me. I've never seen such men, I never will again . . . men like Pirithous, Dryas, that fine captain, Caeneus and Exadius, and Polyphemus, royal prince, and Theseus, Aegeus' boy, a match for the immortals. They were the strongest mortals ever bred on earth, the strongest, and they fought against the strongest too, shaggy Centaurs, wild brutes of the mountains— they hacked them down, terrible, deadly work. And I was in their ranks, fresh out of Pylos, far away from home‑they enlisted me themselves and I fought on my own, a free lance, single‑handed. And none of the men who walk the earth these days could battle with those fighters, none, but they, they took to heart my counsels, marked my words. So now you listen too. Yielding is far better . . . Don't seize the girl, Agamemnon, powerful as you are— leave her, just as the sons of Achaea gave her, his prize from the very first. And you, Achilles, never hope to fight it out with your king, pitting force against his force: no one can match the honors dealt a king, you know, a sceptered king to whom great Zeus gives glory. Strong as you area goddess was your mother­ he has more power because he rules more men. Atrides, end your anger‑look, it's Nestorl I beg you, cool your fury against Achilles. Here the man stands over all Achaea's armies, our rugged bulwark braced for shocks of war." But King Agamemnon answered him in haste, "True, old man—all you say is fit and proper— but this soldier wants to tower over the armies, he wants to rule over all, to lord it over all, give out orders to every man in sight. Well, there's one, I trust, who will never yield to him! What if the everlasting gods have made a Spearman of him? Have they entitled him to hurl abuse at me?" "Yes!"—blazing Achilles broke in quickly— "What a worthless, burnt‑out coward I'd be called if I would submit to you and all your orders, whatever you blurt out. Fling them at others, don't give me commands! Never again, I trust, will Achilles yield to you. And I tell you this‑take it to heart, I warn you— ­my hands will never do battle for that girl, neither with you, King, nor any man alive. You Achaeans gave her, now you've snatched her back. But all the rest I possess beside my fast black ship— not one bit of it can you seize against my will, Atrides. Come, try it! So the men can see, that instant, your black blood gush and spurt around my spear!" Once the two had fought it out with words, battling face‑to‑face, both sprang to their feet and broke up the muster beside the Argive squadrons. Achilles strode off to his trim ships and shelters, back to his friend Patroclus and their comrades. Agamemnon had a vessel hauled down to the sea, he picked out twenty oarsmen to man her locks, put aboard the cattle for sacrifice to the god and led Chryseis in all her beauty amidships. Versatile Odysseus took the helm as captain. All embarked, the patty launched out on the sea's foaming lanes while the son of Atreus told his troops to wash, to purify themselves from the filth of plague. They scoured it off, threw scourings in the surf and sacrificed to Apollo full‑grown bulls and goats along the beaten shore of the fallow barren sea and savory smoke went swirling up the skies. So the men were engaged throughout the camp. But King Agamemnon would not stop the quarrel, the first threat he hurled against Achilles. He called Talthybius and Eurybates briskly, his two heralds, ready, willing aides: "Go to Achilles' lodge. Take Briseis at once, his beauty Briseis by the hand and bring her here. But if he will not surrender her, I'll go myself, I'll seize her myself, with an army at my back— and all the worse for him!" He sent them off with the strict order ringing in their ears. Against their will the two men made their way along the breaking surf of the barren salt sea and reached the Myrmidon shelters and their ships. They found him beside his lodge and black hull, seated grimly—and Achilles took no joy when he saw the two approaching. They were afraid, they held the king in awe and stood there, silent. Not a word to Achilles, not a question. But he sensed it all in his heart, their fear, their charge, and broke the silence for them: "Welcome, couriers! Good heralds of Zeus and men, here, come closer. You have done nothing to me. You are not to blame. No one but Agamemnon— he is the one who sent you for Briseis. Go, Patroclus, Prince, bring out the girl and hand her to them so they can take her back. But let them both bear witness to my loss . . . in the face of blissful gods and mortal men, in the face of that unbending, ruthless king— if the day should come when the armies need me to save their ranks from ignominious, stark defeat. The man is raving—with all the murderous fury in his heart. He lacks the sense to see a day behind, a day ahead, and safeguard the Achaeans battling by the ships." Patroclus obeyed his great friend's command. He led Briseis in all her beauty from the lodge and handed her over to the men to take away. And the two walked back along the Argive ships while she trailed on behind, reluctant, every step. But Achilles wept, and slipping away from his companions, far apart, sat down on the beach of the heaving gray sea and scanned the endless ocean. Reaching out his arms, again and again he prayed to his dear mother: "Mother! You gave me life, short as that life will be, so at least Olympian Zeus, thundering up on high, should give me honor‑but now he gives me nothing. Atreus' son Agamemnon, for all his far‑flung kingdoms— the man disgraces me, seizes and keeps my prize, he tears her away himself!" So he wept and prayed and his noble mother heard him, seated near her father, the Old Man of the Sea in the salt green depths. Suddenly up she rose from the churning surf like mist and settling down beside him as he wept, stroked Achilles gently, whispering his name, "My child— why in tears? What sorrow has touched your heart? Tell me, please. Don't harbor it deep inside you. We must share it all." And now from his depths the proud runner groaned: "You know, you know, why labor through it all? You know it all so well . . . We raided Thebe once, Eetion's sacred citadel, we ravaged the place, hauled all the plunder here and the armies passed it round, share and share alike, and they chose the beauty Chryseis for Agamemnon. But soon her father, the holy priest of Apollo the distant deadly Archer, Chryses approached the fast trim ships of the Argives armed in bronze to win his daughter back, bringing a priceless ransom and bearing high in hand, wound on a golden staff, the wreaths of the god who strikes from worlds away. He begged the whole Achaean army but most of all the two supreme commanders, Atreus' two sons, and all ranks of Achaeans cried out their assent, 'Respect the priest, accept the shining ransom!' But it brought no joy to the heart of Agamemnon, our high and mighty king dismissed the priest| with a brutal order ringing in his ears. And shattered with anger, the old man withdrew but Apollo heard his prayer—he loved him, deeply— he loosed his shaft at the Argives, withering plague, and now the troops began to drop and die in droves, the arrows of god went showering left and right, whipping through the Achaeans' vast encampment. But the old seer who knew the cause full well revealed the will of the archer god Apollo. And I was the first, mother, I urged them all, 'Appease the god at once!' That's when the fury gripped the son of Atreus. Agamemnon leapt to his feet and hurled his threat—his threat's been driven home. One girl, Chryseis, the fiery‑eyed Achaeans ferry out in a fast trim ship to Chryse Island, laden with presents for the god. The other girl, just now, the heralds came and led her away from camp, Briseus' daughter, the prize the armies gave me. But you, mother, if you have any power at all, rotect your son! Go to Olympus, plead with Zeus, if you ever warmed his heart with a word or any action . . . Time and again I heard your claims in father's halls, boasting how you and you alone of all the immortals rescued Zeus, the lord of the dark storm cloud, from ignominious, stark defeat . . . That day the Olympians tried to chain him down, Hera, Poseidon lord of the sea, and Pallas Athena— you rushed to Zeus, dear Goddess, broke those chains, quickly ordered the hundred‑hander to steep Olympus, that monster whom the immortals call Briareus but every mortal calls the Sea‑god's son, Aegaeon, though he's stronger than his father. Down he sat, flanking Cronus' son, gargantuan in the glory of it all, and the blessed gods were struck with terror then, they stopped shackling Zeus. Remind him of that, now, go and sit beside him, grasp his knees . . . persuade him, somehow, to help the Trojan cause, to pin the Achaeans back against their ships, trap them round the bay and mow them down. So all can reap the benefits of their king­ so even mighty Atrides can see how mad he was to disgrace Achilles, the best of the Achaeans!" And Thetis answered, bursting into tears, "O my son, my sorrow, why did I ever bear you? All I bore was doom . . . Would to god you could linger by your ships without a grief in the world, without a torment! Doomed to a short life, you have so little time. And not only short, now, but filled with heartbreak too, more than all other men alive—doomed twice over. Ah to a cruel fate I bore you in our halls! Still, I shall go to Olympus crowned with snow and repeat your prayer to Zeus who loves the lightning. Perhaps he will be persuaded. But you, my child, stay here by the fast ships, rage on at the Achaeans, just keep clear of every foray in the fighting. Only yesterday Zeus went off to the Ocean River to feast with the Aethiopians, loyal, lordly men, and all the gods went with him. But in twelve days the Father returns to Olympus. Then, for your sake, up I go to the bronze floor, the royal house of Zeus— I'll grasp his knees, I think I'll win him over." With that vow his mother went away and left him there, alone, his heart inflamed for the sashed and lovely girl they'd wrenched away from him against his will. Meanwhile Odysseus drew in close to Chryse Island, bearing the splendid sacrifice in the vessel's hold. And once they had entered the harbor deep in bays they furled and stowed the sail in the black ship, they lowered the mast by the forestays, smoothly, quickly let it down on the forked mast‑crutch and rowed her into a mooring under oars. Out went the bow-stones—cables fast astern— ­and the crew themselves swung out in the breaking surf, leading out the sacrifice for the archer god Apollo, and out of the deep‑sea ship Chryseis stepped too. Then tactful Odysseus led her up to the altar, placing her in her loving father's arms, and said, "Chryses, the lord of men Agamemnon sent me here to bring your daughter back and perform a sacrifice, a grand sacrifice to Apollo—for all Achaea's sake— so we can appease the god who's loosed such grief and torment on the Argives." With those words he left her in Chryses' arms and the priest embraced the child he loved, exultant. At once the men arranged the sacrifice for Apollo, making the cattle ring his well‑built altar, then they rinsed their hands and took up barley. Rising among them Chryses stretched his arms to the sky and prayed in a high resounding voice, "Hear me, Apollo! God of the silver bow who strides the walls of Chryse and Cilla sacrosanct—lord in power of Tenedos! If you honored me last time and heard my prayer and rained destruction down on all Achaea's ranks, now bung my prayer to pass once more. Now, at last, drive this killing plague from the armies of Achaea!" His prayer went up and Phoebus Apollo heard him. And soon as the men had prayed and flung the barley, first they lifted back the heads of the victims, slit their throats, skinned them and carved away the meat from the thighbones and wrapped them in fat, a double fold sliced clean and topped with strips of flesh. And the old man burned these over dried split wood and over the quarters poured out glistening wine while young men at his side held five‑pronged forks. Once they had burned the bones and tasted the organs they cut the rest into pieces, pierced them with spits, roasted them to a turn and pulled them off the fire. The work done, the feast laid out, they ate well and no man's hunger lacked a share of the banquet. When they had put aside desire for food and drink, the young men brimmed the mixing bowls with wine and tipping first drops for the god in every cup they poured full rounds for all. And all day long they appeased the god with song, raising a ringing hymn to the distant archer god who drives away the plague, those young Achaean warriors singing out his power, and Apollo listened, his great heart warm with joy. Then when the sun went down and night came on they made their beds and slept by the stern‑cables . . . When young Dawn with her rose‑red fingers shone once more, they set sail for the main encampment of Achaea. The Archer sent them a bracing following wind, they stepped the mast, spread white sails wide, the wind hit full and the canvas bellied out and a dark blue wave, foaming up at the bow, sang out loud and strong as the ship made way, skimming the whitecaps, cutting toward her goal. And once offshore of Achaea's vast encampment they eased her in and hauled the black ship high, far up on the sand, and shored her up with timbers. Then they scattered, each to his own ship and shelter. But he raged on, grimly camped by his fast fleet, the royal son of Peleus, the swift runner Achilles. Now he no longer haunted the meeting grounds where men win glory, now he no longer went to war but day after day he ground his heart out, waiting there, yearning, always yearning for battle cries and combat. But now as the twelfth dawn after this shone clear the gods who live forever marched home to Olympus, all in a long cortege, and Zeus led their on. And Thetis did not forget her son's appeals. She broke from a cresting wave at first light and soaring up to the broad sky and Mount Olympus, found the son of Cronus gazing down on the world, peaks apart from the other gods and seated high on the topmost crown of rugged ridged Olympus. And crouching down at his feet, quickly grasping his knees with her left hand, her right hand holding him underneath the chin, she prayed to the lord god Zeus, the son of Cronus: "Zeus, Father Zeus! If I ever served you well among the deathless gods with a word or action, bring this prayer to pass: honor my son Achilles!— doomed to the shortest life of any man on earth. And now the lord of men Agamemnon has disgraced him, seizes and keeps his prize, tears her away himself. But you— exalt him, Olympian Zeus: your urgings rule the world! Come, grant the Trojans victory after victory till the Achaean armies pay my dear son back, building higher the honor he deserves!" She paused but Zeus who commands the storm clouds answered nothing. The Father sat there, silent. It seemed an eternity . . . But Thetis, clasping his knees, held on, clinging, pressing her question once again: "Grant my prayer, once and for all, Father, bow your head in assent! Or deny me outright. What have you to fear? So I may know, too well, just how cruelly I am the most dishonored goddess of them all." Filled with anger Zeus who marshals the storm clouds answered her at last: "Disaster. You will drive me into war with Hera. She will provoke me, she with her shrill abuse. Even now in the face of all the immortal gods she harries me perpetually, Hera charges me that I always go to battle for the Trojans. Away with you now. Hera might catch us here. I will see to this. I will bring it all to pass. Look, I will bow my head if that will satisfy you. That, I remind you, that among the immortal gods is the strongest, truest sign that I can give. No word or work of mine‑nothing can be revoked, there is no treachery, nothing left unfinished once I bow my head to say it shall be done." So he decreed. And Zeus the son of Cronus bowed his craggy dark brows and the deathless locks came pouring down from the thunderhead of the great immortal king and giant shock waves spread through all Olympus. So the two of them made their pact and parted. Deep in the sea she dove from radiant Mount Olympus. Zeus went back to his own halls, and all the gods in full assembly rose from their seats at once to meet the Father striding toward them now None dared remain at rest as Zeus advanced, they all sprang up to greet him face‑to‑face as he took his place before them on his throne. But Hera knew it all. She had seen how Thetis, the Old Man of the Sea's daughter, Thetis quick on her glistening feet was hatching plans with Zeus. And suddenly Hera taunted the Father, son of Cronus: "So, who of the gods this time, my treacherous one, was hatching plans with you? Always your pleasure, whenever my back is turned, to settle things in your grand clandestine way. You never deign, do you, freely and frankly, to share your plots with me—never, not a word!" The father of men and gods replied sharply, "Hera—stop hoping to fathom all my thoughts. You will find them a trial, though you are my wife. Whatever is right for you to hear, no one, trust me, will know of it before you, neither god nor man. Whatever I choose to plan apart from all the gods— no more of your everlasting questions, probe and pry no more." And Hera the Queen, her dark eyes wide, exclaimed, "Dread majesty, son of Cronus, what are you saying? Now surely I've never probed or pried in the past. Why, you can scheme to your heart's content without a qualm in the world for me. But now I have a terrible fear that she has won you over, Thetis, the Old Man of the Sea's daughter, Thetis with her glistening feet. I know it. Just at dawn she knelt down beside you and grasped your knees and I suspect you bowed your head in assent to her— ­you granted once and for all to exalt Achilles now arid slaughter hordes of Achaeans pinned against their ships." And Zeus who marshals the thunderheads returned, "Maddening one . . . you and your eternal suspicions — can never escape you. Ah but tell me, Hera, just what can you do about all this? Nothing. Only estrange yourself from me a little more— and all the worse for you. If what you say is true, that must be my pleasure. Now go sit down. Be quiet now. Obey my orders, for fear the gods, however many Olympus holds, are powerless to protect you when I come to throttle you with my irresistible hands." He subsided but Hera the Queen, her eyes wider, was terrified. She sat in silence. She wrenched her will to his. And throughout the halls of Zeus the gods of heaven quaked with fear. Hephaestus the Master Craftsman rose up first to harangue them all, trying now to bring his loving mother a little comfort, the white‑armed goddess Hera: "Oh disaster . . . that's what it is, and it will be unbearable if the two of you must come to blows this way, flinging the gods in chaos just for mortal men. No more joy for us in the sumptuous feast when riot rules the day. I urge you, mother—you know that I am right— work back into his good graces, so the Father, our beloved Father will never wheel on us again, send our banquets crashing! The Olympian lord of lightning— what if he would like to blast us from our seats? He is far too strong. Go back to him, mother, stroke the Father with soft, winning words— at once the Olympian will turn kind to us again." Pleading, springing up with a two‑handled cup, he reached it toward his loving mother's hands with his own winning words: "Patience, mother! Grieved as you are, bear up, or dear as you are, I have to see you beaten right before my eyes. I would be shattered‑what could I do to save you? It's hard to fight the Olympian strength for strength. You remember the last time I rushed to your defense? He seized my foot, he hurled me off the tremendous threshold and all day long I dropped, I was dead weight and then, when the sun went down, down I plunged on Lemnos, little breath left in me. But the mortals there soon nursed a fallen immortal back to life." At that the white‑armed goddess Hera smiled and smiling, took the cup from her child's hands. Then dipping sweet nectar up from the mixing bowl he poured it round to all the immortals, left to right. And uncontrollable laughter broke from the happy gods as they watched the god of fire breathing hard and bustling through the halls. That hour then and all day long till the sun went down they feasted and no god's hunger lacked a share of the handsome banquet or the gorgeous lyre Apollo struck or the Muses singing voice to voice in choirs, their vibrant music rising. At last, when the sun's fiery light had set, each immortal went to rest in his own house, the splendid high halls Hephaestus built for each with all his craft and cunning, the famous crippled Smith. And Olympian Zeus the lord of lightning went to his own bed where he had always lain when welcome sleep came on him. There he climbed and there he slept and by his side lay Hera the Queen, the goddess of the golden throne. Now the great array of gods and chariot-driving men slept all night long, but the peaceful grip of sleep could not hold Zeus, turning it over in his mind ... how to exalt Achilles?-how to slaughter hordes of Achaeans pinned against their ships? As his spirit churned, at last one plan seemed best: he would send a murderous dream to Agamemnon. Calling out to the vision, Zeus winged it on: "Go, murderous Dream, to the fast Achaean ships and once you reach Agamemnon's shelter rouse him, order him, word-for-word, exactly as I command. Tell Atrides to arm his long-haired Achaeans, to attack at once, full force- now he can take the broad streets of Troy. The immortal gods who hold Olympus clash no more, Hera's appeals have brought them round and all agree: griefs are about to crush the men of Troy." At that command the dream went winging off, and passing quickly along the fast trim ships, made for the king and found him soon, sound asleep in his tent with refreshing godsent slumber drifted round him. Hovering at his head the vision rose like Nestor, Neleus' son, the chief Agamemnon honored most. Inspired with Nestor's voice and sent by Zeus, the dream cried out, "Still asleep, Agamemnon? The son of Atreus, that skilled breaker of horses? How can you sleep all night, a man weighed down with duties? Your armies turning over their lives to your command- responsibilities so heavy. Listen to me, quickly! I bring you a message sent by Zeus, a world away but he has you in his heart, he pities-you now ... Zeus commands you to arm your long-haired Achaeans, to attack at once, full force- now you can take the broad streets of Troy! The immortal gods who hold Olympus clash no more, Hera's appeals have brought them round and all agree: griefs from Zeus are about to crush the men of Troy! But keepthis message firmly in your mind. Remember-let no loss of memory overcome you when the sweet grip of slumber sets you free." With that the dream departed, leaving him there, his heart racing with hopes that would not come to pass. He thought he would take the city of Priam then, that very day, the fool. How could he know what work the Father had in mind? The Father, still bent on plaguing the Argives and Trojans both with wounds and groans in the bloody press of battle. But rousing himself from sleep, the divine voice swirling round him, Atrides sat up, bolt awake, pulled on- a soft tunic, linen never worn, and over it threw his flaring battle-cape, under his smooth feet he fastened supple sandals, across his shoulder slung his silver-studded sword. Then he seized the royal scepter of his fathers- its power can never die-and grasping it tightly off he strode to the ships of Argives armed in bronze. Now the goddess Dawn climbed up to Olympus heights, declaring the light of day to Zeus and the deathless gods as the king commanded heralds to cry out loud and clear and muster the long-haired Achaeans to full assembly. Their cries rang out. Battalions gathered quickly. But first he called his ranking chiefs to council beside the ship of Nestor, the warlord born in Pylos. Summoning them together there Atrides set forth his cunning, foolproof plan: "Hear me, friends- a dream sent by the gods has come to me in sleep. Down through the bracing godsent night it came like good Nestor in features, height and build, the old king himself, and hovering at my head the dream called me on: 'Still asleep, Agamemnon? The son of Atreus, that skilled breaker of horses? How can you sleep all night, a man weighed down with duties? Your armies turning over their lives to your command- responsibilities so heavy. Listen to me, quickly! I bring you a message sent by Zeus, a world away but he has you in his heart, he pities you now .. . Zeus commands you to arm your long-haired Achaeans, to attack at once, full force- now you can take the broad streets of Troy! The immortal gods who hold Olympus clash no more, Hera's appeals have brought them round and all agree: griefs from Zeus are about to crush the men of Troy! But keep this message firmly in your mind.’ With that the dream went winging off and soothing sleep released me. Come-see if we can arm the Achaeans for assault. But first, according to time-honored custom, I will test the men with a challenge, tell them all to crowd the oarlocks, cut and run in their ships. But you take up your battle-stations at every point, command them, hold them back." So much for his plan. Agamemnon took his seat and Nestor rose among them. Noble Nestor the king of Pylos' sandy harbor spoke and urged them on with all good will: "Friends, lords of the Argives, 0 my captains! If any other Achaean had told us of this dream we'd call it false and turn our backs upon it. But look, the man who saw it has every claim to be the best, the bravest Achaean we can field. Come-see if we can arm the Achaeans for assault." And out he marched, leading the way from council. The rest sprang to their feet, the sceptered kings obeyed the great field marshal. Rank and file streamed behind and rushed like swarms of bees pouring out of a rocky hollow, burst on endless burst, bunched in clusters seething over the first spring blooms, dark hordes swirling into the air, this way, that way- so the many armed platoons from the ships and tents came marching on, close-file, along the deep wide beach to crowd the meeting grounds, and Rumor, Zeus's crier, like wildfire blazing among them, whipped them on. The troops assembled. The meeting grounds shook. The earth groaned and rumbled under the huge weight as soldiers took positions-the whole place in uproar. Nine heralds shouted out, trying to keep some order, "Quiet, battalions, -silence! Hear your royal kings!" The men were forced to their seats, marshaled into ranks, the shouting died away . . . silence. King Agamemnon rose to his feet, raising high in hand the scepter Hephaestus made with all his strength and skill. Hephaestus gave it to Cronus' son, Father Zeus, and Zeus gave it to Hermes, the giant-killing Guide and Hermes gave it to Pelops, that fine charioteer, Pelops gave it to Atreus, marshal of fighting men, who died and passed it on to Thyestes rich in flocks and he in turn bestowed it on Agamemnon, to bear on high as he ruled his many islands and lorded mainland Argos. Now, leaning his weight upon that kingly scepter, Atrides declared his will to all Achaea's armies: "Friends-fighting Danaans, aides-in-arms of Ares! Cronus' son has trapped me in madness, blinding ruin- Zeus is a harsh, cruel god. He vowed to me long ago, he bowed his head that I should never embark for home till I had brought the walls of Ilium crashing down. But now, I see, he only plotted brutal treachery: now he commands me back to Argos in disgrace, whole regiments of my men destroyed in battle. So it must please his overweening heart, who knows? Father Zeus has lopped the crowns of a thousand cities, true, and Zeus will lop still more-his power is too great. What humiliation! Even for generations still to come, to learn that Achaean armies so strong, so vast, fought a futile war ... We are still fighting it, no end in sight, and battling forces we outnumber- by far. Say that Trojans and Argives both agreed to swear a truce, to seal their oaths in blood, and opposing sides were tallied out in full: count one by one the Trojans who live in Troy but count our Achaeans out by ten-man squads and each squad pick a Trojan to pour its wine- many Achaean tens would lack their steward then! That's how far we outnumber them, I'd say-Achaeans to Trojans-the men who hail from Troy at least. But they have allies called from countless cities, fighters brandishing spears who block my way, who throw me far off course, thwarting my will to plunder Ilium's rugged walls. And now nine years of almighty Zeus have marched by, our ship timbers rot and the cables snap and fray and across the sea our wives and helpless children wait in the halls, wait for our return ... And we? Our work drags on, unfinished as always, hopeless- the labor of war that brought us here to Troy. So come, follow my orders. All obey me now. Cut and run! Sail home to the fatherland we love! We'll never take the broad streets of Troy." Testing his men but he only made the spirit race inside their chests, all the rank and file who'd never heard his plan. And the whole assembly surged like big waves at sea, the Icarian Sea when East and South Winds drive it on, blasting down in force from the clouds of Father Zeus, or when the West Wind shakes the deep standing grain with hurricane gusts that flatten down the stalks- so the massed assembly of troops was shaken now. They cried in alarm and charged toward the ships and the dust went whirling up from under rushing feet as the men jostled back and forth, shouting orders- "Grapple the ships! Drag them down to the bright sea! Clean out the launching-channels!" Shrill shouts hitting the heavens, fighters racing for home, knocking the blocks out underneath the hulls. And now they might have won their journey home, the men of Argos fighting the will of fate, yes, if Hera had not alerted Athena: "Inconceivable! Child of Zeus whose battle-shield is thunder, tireless one, Athena-what, is this the way? All the Argives flying home to their fatherland, sailing over the sea's broad back? Leaving Priam and all the men of Troy a trophy to glory over, Helen of Argos, Helen for whom so many Argives lost their lives in Troy, far from native land. Go, range the ranks of Achaeans armed in bronze. With your winning words hold back each man you find- don't let them haul their rolling ships to sea!" The bright-eyed goddess Pallas lost no time. Down she flashed from the peaks of Mount Olympus, quickly reached the ships and found Odysseus first, a mastermind like Zeus, still standing fast. He had not laid a hand on his black benched hull, such anguish racked his heart and fighting spirit. Now close beside him the bright-eyed goddess stood and urged him on: "Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, great tactician-what, is this the way? All you Argives flying home to your fatherland, tumbling into your oar-swept ships? Leaving Priam and all the men of Troy a trophy to glory over, Helen of Argos, Helen for whom so many Argives lost their lives in Troy, far from native land! No, don't give up now. Range the Achaean ranks, with your winning words hold back each man you find- don't let them haul their rolling ships to sea!" He knew the goddess' voice-he went on the run, flinging off his cape as Eurybates picked it up, the herald of Ithaca always at his side. Coming face-to-face with Atrides Agamemnon, he relieved him of his fathers' royal scepter- its power can never die-and grasping it tightly off he strode to the ships of Argives armed in bronze. Whenever Odysseus met some man of rank, a king, he'd halt and hold him back with winning words: "My friend-it's wrong to threaten you like a coward, but you stand fast, you keep your men in check! It's too soon to see Agamemnon's purpose clearly. Now he's only testing us, soon he'll bear down hard. Didn't we all hear his plan in secret council? God forbid his anger destroy the army he commands. The rage of kings is strong, they're nursed by the gods, their honor comes from Zeus- they're dear to Zeus, the god who rules the world." When he caught some common soldier shouting out, he'd beat him with the scepter, dress him down: "You fool-sit still! Obey the commands of others, your superiors-you, you deserter, rank coward, you count for nothing, neither in war nor council. How can all Achaeans be masters here in Troy? Too many kings can ruin an army-mob rule! Let there be one commander, one master only, endowed by the son of crooked-minded Cronus with kingly scepter and royal rights of custom: whatever one man needs to lead his people well." So he ranged the ranks, commanding men to order- and back again they surged from ships and shelters, back to the meeting grounds with a deep pounding din, thundering out as battle lines of breakers crash and drag along some endless beach, and the rough sea roars. The armies took their seats, marshaled into ranks. But one man, Thersites, still railed on, nonstop. His head was full of obscenities, teeming with rant, all for no good reason, insubordinate, baiting the kings- anything to provoke some laughter from the troops. Here was the ugliest man who ever came to Troy. Bandy-legged he was, with one foot clubbed, both shoulders humped together, curving over his caved-in chest, and bobbing above them his skull warped to a point, sprouting clumps of scraggly, woolly hair. Achilles despised him most, Odysseus too- he was always abusing both chiefs, but now he went for majestic Agamemnon, hollering out, taunting the king with strings of cutting insults. The Achaeans were furious with him, deeply offended. But he kept shouting at Agamemnon, spewing his abuse: "Still moaning and groaning, mighty Atrides-why now? What are you panting after now? Your shelters packed with the lion's share of bronze, plenty of women too, crowding your lodges. Best of the lot, the beauties we hand you first, whenever we take some stronghold. Or still more gold you're wanting? More ransom a son of the stallion-breaking Trojans might just fetch from Troy?- though I or another hero drags him back in chains ... Or a young woman, is it?-to spread and couple, to bed down for yourself apart from all the troops? How shameful for you, the high and mighty commander, to lead the sons of Achaea into bloody slaughter! Sons? No, my soft friends, wretched excuses- women, not men of Achaea! Home we go in our ships! Abandon him here in Troy to wallow in all his prizes- he'll see if the likes of us have propped him up or not. Look-now it's Achilles, a greater man he disgraces, seizes and keeps his prize, tears her away himself. But no gall in Achilles. Achilles lets it go. If not, Atrides, that outrage would have been your last!" So Thersites taunted the famous field marshal. But Odysseus stepped in quickly, faced him down with a dark glance and threats to break his nerve: "What a flood of abuse, Thersites! Even for you, fluent and flowing as you are. Keep quiet. Who are you to wrangle with kings, you alone? No one, I say-no one alive less soldierly than you, none in the ranks that came to Troy with Agamemnon. So stop your babbling, mouthing the names of kings, flinging indecencies in their teeth, your eyes peeled for a chance to cut and run for home. We can have no idea, no clear idea at all how the long campaign will end ... whether Achaea's sons will make it home unharmed or slink back in disgrace. But there you sit, hurling abuse at the son of Atreus, Agamemnon, marshal of armies, simply because our fighters give Atrides the lion's share of all our plunder. You and your ranting slander you're the outrage. I tell you this, so help me it's the truth: if I catch you again, blithering on this way, let Odysseus' head be wrenched off his shoulders, never again call me the father of Telemachus if I don't grab you, strip the clothing off you, cloak, tunic and rags that wrap your private parts, and whip you howling naked back to the fast ships, out of the armies' muster-whip you like a cur!" And he cracked the scepter across his back and shoulders. The rascal doubled over, tears streaking his face and a bloody welt bulged up between his blades, under the stroke of the golden scepter's studs. He squatted low, cringing, stunned with pain, blinking like some idiot ... rubbing his tears off dumbly with a fist. Their morale was low but the men laughed now, good hearty laughter breaking over Thersites' head- glancing at neighbors they would shout, "A terrific stroke! A thousand terrific strokes he's carried off Odysseus, taking the lead in tactics, mapping battle-plans. But here's the best thing yet he's done for the men- he's put a stop to this babbling, foulmouthed fool! Never again, I'd say, will our gallant comrade risk his skin to attack the kings with insults." So the soldiers bantered but not Odysseus. The raider of cities stood there, scepter in hand, and close beside him the great gray-eyed Athena rose like a herald, ordering men to silence. All, from the first to lowest ranks of Achaea's troops, should hear his words and mark his counsel well. For the good of all he urged them: "Agamemnon! Now, my king, the Achaeans are bent on making you a disgrace in the eyes of every man alive. Yes, they fail to fulfill their promise sworn that day they sailed here from the stallion-land of Argos: that not until you had razed the rugged walls of Troy would they sail home again. But look at them now, like green, defenseless boys or widowed women whimpering to each other, wailing to journey back. True, they've labored long-they're desperate for home. Any fighter, cut off from his wife for one month, would chafe at the benches, moaning in his ship, pinned down by gales and heavy, raging seas. A month-but look at us. This is the ninth year come round, the ninth we've hung on here. Who could blame the Achaeans for chafing, bridling beside the beaked ships? Ah but still-what a humiliation it would be to hold out so long, then sail home empty-handed. Courage, my friends, hold out a little longer. Till we see if Caichas divined the truth or not. We all recall that moment-who could forget it? We were all witnesses then. All, at least, the deadly spirits have not dragged away ... Why, it seems like only yesterday or the day before when our vast armada gathered, moored at Aulis, freighted with slaughter bound for Priam's Troy. We were all busy then, milling round a spring and offering victims up on the holy altars, full sacrifice to the gods to guarantee success, under a spreading plane tree where the water splashed, glittering in the sun-when a great omen appeared. A snake, and his back streaked red with blood, a thing of terror! Olympian Zeus himself had launched him into the clean light of day ... He slid from under the altar, glided up the tree and there the brood of a sparrow, helpless young ones, teetered high on the topmost branch-tips, cowering under the leaves there, eight they were all told and the mother made the ninth, she'd borne them all- chirping to break the heart but the snake gulped them down and the mother cried out for her babies, fluttering over him ... he coiled, struck, fanging her wing-a high thin shriek! But once he'd swallowed down the sparrow with her brood, the son of crooked Cronus who sent the serpent forth turned him into a sign, a monument clear to see- Zeus struck him to stone! And we stood by,' amazed that such a marvel came to light. So then, when those terrible, monstrous omens burst in on the victims we were offering to the gods, Calchas swiftly revealed the will of Zeus: 'Why struck dumb now, my long-haired Achaeans? Zeus who rules the world has shown us an awesome sign, an event long in the future, late to come to birth but the fame of that great work will never die. As the snake devoured the sparrow with her brood, eight and the mother made the ninth, she'd borne them all, so we will fight in Troy that many years and then, then in the tenth we'll take her broad streets.' So that day the prophet revealed the future- and now, look, by god, it all comes to passl Up with you, all you Argives geared for combat, stand your ground, right here, until we take the mighty walls of Priam!" He fired them so the armies roared and the ships resounded round them, shattering echoes ringing from their shouts as Argives cried assent to King Odysseus' words. And Nestor the noble horseman spurred them more: "What disgrace! Look at you, carrying on in the armies' muster just like boys-fools! Not a thought in your heads for works of battle. What becomes of them now, the pacts and oaths we swore? Into the flames with councils, all the plans of men, the vows sealed with the strong, unmixed wine, the firm clasp of the right hand we trusted! We battle on in words, as always, mere words, and what's the cure? We cannot find a thing. No matter how many years we wrangle here. Agamemnon- never swerve, hold to your first plan of action, lead your armies headlong into war! The rest of them? Let them rot, the one or two who hatch their plans apart from all the troops- what good can they win from that? Nothing at all. Why, they'd scuttle home before they can even learn_ if the vows of Zeus with his dark cloudy shield are false or not. Zeus the son of almighty Cronus, I remind you, bowed his head that day we boarded ship, all the Argives laden with blood and death for Troy- his lightning bolts on the right, good omens blazing forth. So now let no man hurry to sail for home, not yet ... not till he beds down with a faithful Trojan wife, payment in full for the groans and shocks of war we have all borne for Helen. But any soldier wild with desire to reach his home at once- just let him lay a hand on his black benched ship and right in front of the rest he'll reach his death! But you, my King, be on your guard yourself. Come, listen well to another man. Here's some advice, not to be tossed aside, and I will tell it clearly. Range your men by tribes, even by clans, Agamemnon, so clan fights by the side of clan, tribe by tribe. Fight this way, if the Argives still obey you, then you can see which captain is a coward, which contingent too, and which is loyal, brave, since they will fight in separate formations of their own. Then, what's more, if you fail to sack the city, you will know if the will of god's to blame or the cowardice of your men :inept in battle." And King Agamemnon took his lead, saluting: "Again, old man, you outfight the Argives in debate! Father Zeus, Athena, Apollo, if only I had ten men like Nestor to plan with me among Achaea's armies- then we could topple Priam's citadel in a day, throttle it in our hands and gut Troy to nothing. But Cronus' son, Zeus with his shield of storm insists on embroiling me in painful struggles, futile wars of words ... Imagine-I and Achilles, wrangling over a girl, battling man-to-man. And I, I was the first to let my anger flare. Ah if the two of us could ever think as one, Troy could delay her day of death no longer, not one moment. Go now, take your meal-the sooner to bring on war. Quickly-let each fighter sharpen his spear well, balance his shield well, feed his horses well with plenty of grain to build their racing speed- each man look well to his chariot's running order, nerve himself for combat now, so all day long we can last out the grueling duels of Ares! No breathing space, no letup, not a moment, not till the night comes on to part the fighters' fury! Now sweat will soak the shield-strap round your chest, your fist gripping the spear will ache with tensing, now the lather will drench your war-team's flanks, hauling your sturdy chariot. But any man I catch, trying to skulk behind his long beaked ships, hanging back from battle-he is finished. No way for him to escape the dogs and birds!" So he commanded and the armies gave a deep resounding roar like waves crashing against a cliff when the South Wind whips it, bearing down, some craggy headland jutting out to sea- the waves will never leave it in peace, thrashed by gales that hit from every quarter, breakers left and right. The troops sprang up, scattered back to the ships, lit fires beside their tents and took their meal. Each sacrificed to one or another deathless god, each man praying to flee death and the grind of war. But the lord of men Agamemnon sacrificed a fat rich ox, five years old, to the son of mighty Cronus, Zeus, and called the chiefs of all the Argive forces: Nestor first and foremost, then King Idomeneus, the Great and Little Ajax, Tydeus' son Diomedes and Odysseus sixth, a mastermind like Zeus. The lord of the war cry Menelaus came uncalled, he knew at heart what weighed his brother down. They stood in a ring around the ox, took up barley and then, rising among them, King Agamemnon raised his voice in prayer: "Zeus, Zeus, god of greatness, god of glory, lord god of the dark clouds who lives in the bright sky, don't let the sun go down or the night descend on us! Not till I hurl the smoke-black halls of Priam headlong- torch his gates to blazing rubble-rip the tunic of Hector and slash his heroic chest to ribbons with my bronze- and a ruck of comrades round him, groveling facedown, gnaw their own earth!" And so Agamemnon prayed but the son of Cronus would not bring his prayer to pass, not yet ... the Father accepted the sacrifices, true, but doubled the weight of thankless, ruthless war. Once the men had prayed and flung the barley, first they lifted back the heads of the victims, slit their throats, skinned them and carved away the meat from the thighbones and wrapped them in fat, a double fold sliced clean and topped with strips of flesh. And they burned these on a cleft stick, peeled and dry, spitted the vitals, held them over Hephaestus' flames and once they'd charred the thighs and tasted the organs they cut the rest into pieces, pierced them with spits, roasted them to a turn and pulled them off the fire. The work done, the feast laid out, they ate well and no man's hunger lacked a share of the banquet. When they had put aside desire for food and drink, Nestor the noble old horseman spoke out first: "Marshal Atrides, lord of men Agamemnon, no more trading speeches now. No more delay, putting off the work the god puts in our hands. Come, let the heralds cry out to all contingents, full battle-armor, muster the men along the ships. Now down we go, united-review them as we pass. Down through the vast encampment of Achaea, the faster to rouse the slashing god of war!" Agamemnon the lord of men did not resist. He commanded heralds to cry out loud and clear and summon the long-haired Achaean troops to battle. Their cries rang out. The battalions gathered quickly. The warlords dear to the gods and flanking Agamemnon strode on ahead, marshaling men-at-arms in files, and down their ranks the fiery-eyed Athena bore her awesome shield of storm, ageless, deathless-- a hundred golden tassels, all of them braided tight and each worth a hundred oxen, float along the front. Her shield of lightning dazzling, swirling around her, headlong on Athena swept through the Argive armies, driving soldiers harder, lashing the fighting-fury in each Achaean's heart-no stopping them now, mad for war and struggle. Now, suddenly, battle thrilled them more than the journey home, than sailing hollow ships to their dear native land. As ravening fire rips through big stands of timber high on a mountain ridge and the blaze flares miles away, so from the marching troops the blaze of bronze armor, splendid and superhuman, flared across the earth, flashing into the air to hit the skies. Armies gathering now as the huge flocks on flocks of winging birds, geese or cranes or swans with their long lancing necks-circling Asian marshes round the Cayster outflow, wheeling in all directions, glorying in their wings-keep on landing, advancing, wave on shrieking wave and the tidal flats resound. So tribe on tribe, pouring out of the ships and shelters, marched across the Scamander plain and the earth shook, tremendous thunder from under trampling men and horses drawing into position down the Scamander meadow flats breaking into flower-men by the thousands, numberless as the leaves and spears that flower forth in spring. The armies massing . . . crowding thick-and-fast as the swarms of flies seething over the shepherds' stalls in the first spring days when the buckets flood with milk so many long-haired Achaeans swarmed across the plain to confront the Trojans, fired to smash their lines. The armies grouping now—as seasoned goatherds split their wide-ranging flocks into packs with ease when herds have mixed together down the pasture: so the captains formed their tight platoons, detaching right and left, moving up for action- and there in the midst strode powerful Agamemnon, eyes and head like Zeus who loves the lightning, great in the girth like Ares, god of battles, broad through the chest like sea lord Poseidon. Like a bull rising head and shoulders over the herds, a rbyal bull rearing over his flocks of driven cattle- so imposing was Atreus' son, so Zeus made him that day, towering over fighters, looming over armies. Sing to me now, you Muses who hold the halls of Olympus! You are goddesses, you are everywhere, you know all things- all we hear is the distant ring of glory, we know nothing- who were the captains of Achaea? Who were the kings? The mass of troops I could never tally, never name, not even if I had ten tongues and ten mouths, a tireless voice and the heart inside me bronze, never unless you Muses of Olympus, daughters of Zeus whose shield is rolling thunder, sing, sing in memory all who gathered under Troy. Now I can only tell the lords of the ships, the ships in all their numbers! First came the Boeotian units led by Leitus and Peneleos: Arcesilaus and Prothoenor and Clonius shared command of the armed men who lived in Hyria, rocky Aulis, Schoenus, Scolus and Eteonus spurred with hills, Thespia and Graea, the dancing rings of Mycalessus, men who lived round Harma, Ilesion and Erythrae and those who settled Eleon, Hyle and Peteon, Ocalea, Medeon's fortress walled and strong, Copae, Eutresis and Thisbe thronged with doves, fighters from Coronea, Haliartus deep in meadows, and the men who held Plataea and lived in Glisas, men who held the rough-hewn gates of Lower Thebes, Onchestus the holy, Poseidon's sun-filled grove, men from the town of Ame green with vineyards, Midea and sacred Nisa, Anthedon-on-the-marches. Fifty ships came freighted with these contingents, one hundred and twenty young Boeotians manning each. Then men who lived in Aspledon, Orchomenos of the Minyans, fighters led by Ascalaphus and lalmenus, sons of Ares whom Astyoche bore in Actor son of Azeus' halls when the shy young girl, climbing into the upper rooms, made love with the god of war in secret, shared his strength. In her two sons' command sailed thirty long curved ships. Then Schedius and Epistrophus led the men of Phocis- two sons of Iphitus, that great heart, Naubolus' son- the men who held Cyparissus and Pytho's high crags, the hallowed earth of Crisa, Daulis and Panopeus, men who dwelled round Anemoria, round Hyampolis, men who lived along the Cephisus' glinting waters, men who held Lilaea close to the river's wellsprings. Laden with all their ranks came forty long black ships and Phocian captains ranged them column by column, manning stations along the Boeotians' left flank. Next the Locrians led by racing Ajax, son of Oileus, Little Ajax-a far cry from the size of Telamonian Ajax- a smaller man but trim in his skintight linen corslet, he outthrew all Hellenes, all Achaeans with his spear. He led the men who lived in Opois, Cynus, Calliarus, Bessa and Scarphe, the delightful town of Augeae, Tarphe, and Thronion down the Boagrius River. In Oilean Ajax' charge came forty long black ships, Locrians living across the straits from sacrosanct Euboea. And the men who held Euboea, Abantes breathing fury, Chalcis and Eretria, Histiaea covered with vineyards, Cerinthus along the shore and Dion's hilltop streets, the men who held Carystus and men who settled Styra. Elephenor, comrade of Ares, led the whole contingent, Chalcodon's son, a lord of the fierce Abantes. The sprinting Abantes followed hard at his heels, their forelocks cropped, hair grown long at the back, troops nerved to lunge with their tough ashen spears and slash the enemies' breastplates round their chests. In Elephenor's command sailed forty long black ships. Next the men who held the strong-built city of Athens, realm of high-hearted Erechtheus. Zeus's daughter Athena tended him once the grain-giving fields had borne him, long ago, and then she settled the king in Athens, in her own rich shrine, where sons of Athens worship him with bulls and goats as the years wheel round in season. Athenians all, and Peteos' son Menestheus led them on, and no one born on the earth could match that man in arraying teams of horse and shielded fighters- Nestor his only rival, thanks to Nestor's age. And in his command sailed fifty long black ships. Out of Salamis Great Telamonian Ajax led twelve ships drawn up where Athenian forces formed their line of battle. Then men of Argos and Tiryns with her tremendous walls and Hermione and Asine commanding the deep wide gulf, Troezen, Eionae and Epidaurus green with vines and Achaea's warrior sons who held Aegina and Mases- Diomedes lord of the war cry led their crack contingents flanked by Sthenelus, far-famed Capaneus' favorite son. Third in the vanguard marched Euryalus strong as a god, son of King Mecisteus son of Talaus, but over them all, with cries to marshal men Diomedes led the whole force and his Argives sailed in eighty long black ships. Next the men who held Mycenae's huge walled citadel, Corinth in all her wealth and sturdy, strong Cleonae, men of Orniae, lovely Araethyrea and Sicyon, Adrastus' domain before he ruled Mycenae, men of Hyperesia, Gonoessa perched on hills, men who held Pellene and those who circled Aegion, men of the coastal strip and Helice's broad headland. They came in a hundred ships and Agamemnon led them on, Atreus' royal son, and marching in his companies came the most and bravest fighting men by far. And there ii the midst, armed in gleaming bronze, in all his glory, he towered high over all his fighters- he was the greatest warlord, he led by far the largest army. Next those who held Lacedaemon's hollows deep with gorges, Pharis, Sparta and Messe, crowded haunt of the wild doves, men who lived in Brysiae and Augeae's gracious country, men who held Amyclae, Helos the seaboard fortress, men who settled Laas and lived near Oetylus: Agamemnon's brother, Menelaus lord of the war cry led their sixty ships, armed them apart, downshore, and amidst their ranks he marched, ablaze with valor, priming men for attack. And his own heart blazed the most to avenge the groans and shocks of war they'd borne for Helen. Next the men who lived in Pylos and handsome Arene, Thryon, the Alpheus ford and finely-masoned Aepy, men who lived in Cyparisseis and Amphigenia, Pteleos, Helos and Dorion where the Muses met the Thracian Thamyris, stopped the minstrel's song. From Oechalia he came, from Oechalia's King Eurytus, boasting to high heaven that he could outsing the very Muses, the daughters of Zeus whose shield resounds with thunder. They were enraged, they maimed him, they ripped away his voice, the rousing immortal wonder of his song and wiped all arts of harping from his mind. Nestor the noble old horseman led those troops in ninety sweeping ships lined up along the shore. And those who held Arcadia under Cyllene's peak, near Aepytus' ancient tomb where men fight hand-to-hand, men who lived in Pheneos and Orchomenos rife with sheep, Stratia, Rhipe and Enispe whipped by the sudden winds,, men who settled Tegea, Mantinea's inviting country, men who held Stymphalus, men who ruled Parrhasia- the son of Ancaeus led them, powerful Agapenor with sixty ships in all, and aboard each vessel crowded full Arcadian companies skilled in war. Agamemnon himself, the lord of men had given them those well-benched ships to plow the wine-dark sea, since works of the sea meant nothing to those landsmen. Then the men who lived in Buprasion, brilliant Elis, all the realm as far as Hyrmine and Myrsinus, frontier towns and Olenian Rock and Alesion bound within their borders. Four warlords led their ranks, ten-ship flotillas each, and filling the decks came bands of Epean fighters, two companies under Thalpius and Amphimachus, sons of the line of Actor, one of Eurytus, one of Cteatus. Strong Diores the son of Amarynceus led the third and the princely Polyxinus led the fourth, the son of King Agasthenes, Augeas' noble stock. Then ocean men from Dulichion and the Holy Islands, the Echinades rising over the sea across from Elis- Meges a match for Ares led their troops to war, a son of the rider Phyleus dear to Zeus who once, enraged at his father, fled and settled Dulichion. In his son's command sailed forty long black ships. Next Odysseus led his Cephallenian companies, gallant-hearted fighters, the island men of Ithaca, of Mount Neriton's leafy ridges shimmering in the wind, and men who lived in Crocylia and rugged Aegilips, men who held Zacynthus and men who dwelled near Samos and mainland men who grazed their flocks across the channel. That mastermind like Zeus, Odysseus led those fighters on. In his command sailed twelve ships, prows flashing crimson. And Thoas son of Andraemon led Aetolia's units, soldiers who lived in Pleuron, Pylene and Olenus, Chalcis along the shore and Calydon's rocky heights where the sons of wellbom Oeneus were no more and the king himself was dead and Meleager with his golden hair was gone. So the rule of all Aetolian men had passed to Thoas. In Thoas' command sailed forty long black ships. And the great spearman Idomeneus led his Cretans, the men who held Cnossos and Gortyn ringed in walls, Lyctos, Miletus, Lycastus' bright chalk bluffs, Phaestos and Rhytion, cities a joy to live in- the men who peopled Crete, a hundred cities strong. The renowned spearman Idomeneus led them all in force with Meriones who butchered men like the god of war himself. And in their command sailed eighty long black ships. And Heracles' son Tlepolemus tall and staunch led nine ships of the proud Rhodians out of Rhodes, the men who lived on Rhodes in three island divisions, Lindos and Ialysus and Camirus' white escarpment, armies led by the famous spearman Tlepolemus whom Astyochea bore to Heracles filled with power. He swept her up from Ephyra, from the Selleis River after he'd ravaged many towns of brave young warlords bred by the gods. But soon as his son Tlepolemus came of age in Heracles' well-built palace walls the youngster abruptly killed his father's uncle- the good soldier Licymnius, already up in years- and quickly fitting ships, gathering partisans, he fled across the sea with threats of the sons and the sons' sons of Heracles breaking at his back. But he reached Rhodes at last, a wanderer rocked by storms, and there they settled in three divisions, all by tribes, loved by Zeus himself the king of gods and mortals showering wondrous gold on all their heads. Nireus led his three trim ships from Syme, Nireus the son of Aglaea and King Charopus, Nireus the handsomest man who ever came to Troy, of all the Achaeans after Peleus' fearless son. But he was a lightweight, trailed by a tiny band. And men who held Nisyrus, Casus and Crapathus, Cos, Eurypylus' town, and the islands called Calydnae— combat troops, and Antiphus and Phidippus led them on, the two sons of the warlord Thessalus, Heracles' son. In their command sailed thirty long curved ships. And now, Muse, sing all those fighting men who lived in Pelasgian Argos, the big contingents out of Alus and Alope and Trachis, men of Phthia and Hellas where the women are a wonder, all the fighters called Achaeans, Hellenes and Myrmidons ranked in fifty ships, and Achilles was their leader. But they had no lust for the grind of battle now— where was the man who marched their lines to war? The brilliant runner Achilles lay among his ships, raging over Briseis, the girl with lustrous hair, the prize he seized from Lymessus— after he had fought to exhaustion at Lymessus, storming the heights, and breached the walls of Thebes and toppled the vaunting spearmen Epistrophus and Mynes, sons of King Euenus, Selepius' son. All for Briseis his heart was breaking now . . . Achilles lay there now but he would soon rise up in all his power. Then men of Phylace, Pyrasu's banked in flowers, Demeter's closed and holy grove and Iton mother of flocks, Antron along the shore and Pteleos deep in meadows. The veteran Protesilaus had led those troops while he still lived, but now for many years the arms of the black earth had held him fast and his wife was left behind, alone in Phylace, both cheeks torn in grief, their house half-built. Just as he vaulted off his ship a Dardan killed him, first by far of the Argives slaughtered on the beaches. But not even then were his men without a captain, yearn as they did for their lost leader. No, Podarces a fresh campaigner ranged their units- a son of Iphiclus son of Phylacus rich in flocks- Podarces, gallant Protesilaus' blood brother, younger-born, but the older man proved braver too, an iron man of war. Yet not for a moment did his army lack a leader, yearn as they did for the braver dead. Under Podarces sailed their forty long black ships. And the men who lived in Pherae fronting Lake Boebeis, in Boebe and Glaphyrae and lolcos' sturdy ramparts: their eleven ships were led by Admetus' favored son, Eumelus, born to Admetus by Alcestis, queen of women, the most radiant daughter Pelias ever fathered. Then men who lived in Methone and Thaumacia, men who held Meliboea and rugged ridged Olizon: Philoctetes the master archer had led them on in seven ships with fifty oarsmen aboard each, superbly skilled with the bow in lethal combat. But their captain lay on an island, racked with pain, on Lemnos' holy shores where the armies had marooned him, agonized by his wound, the bite of a deadly water-viper. There he writhed in pain but soon, encamped by the ships, the Argives would recall Philoctetes, their great king. But not even then were his men without a captain, yearn as they did for their lost leader. No, Medon formed them up, Oileus' bastard son whom Rhene bore to Oileus, grim raider of cities. And men who settled Tricca, rocky Ithome terraced high and men who held Oechalia, Oechalian Eurytus' city: the two sons of Asclepius led their units now, both skilled healers, Podalirius and Machaon. In their command sailed forty curved black ships. And men who held Ormenion and the Hyperian Spring, men who held Asterion, Titanos' chalk-white cliffs: Eurypylus marched them on, Euaemon's shining son. In his command sailed forty long black ships. And the men who settled Argissa and Gyrtone, Orthe, Elone, the gleaming citadel Oloosson: Polypoetes braced for battle led them on, the son of Pirithous, son of deathless Zeus. Famous Hippodamia bore the warrior to Pirithous that day he wreaked revenge on the shaggy Centaurs, routed them out of Pelion, drove them to the Aethices. Polypoetes was not alone, Leonteus shared the helm, companion of Ares, Caeneus' grandson, proud Coronus' son. And in his command sailed forty long black ships. And Guneus out of Cyphus led on two and twenty ships and in his platoons came Enienes and battle-tried Peraebians who pitched homes in the teeth of Dodona's bitter winters, who held the tilled acres along the lovely Titaressus that runs her pure crystal currents into Peneus- never mixed with Peneus' eddies glistening silt but gliding over the surface smooth as olive oil, branching, breaking away from the river Styx, the dark and terrible oath-stream of the gods. And Prothous son of Tenthredon led the Magnesians, men who lived around the Peneus, up along Mount Pelion sloped in wind-whipped leaves. Racing Prothous led them on and in his command sailed forty long black ships. These, these were the captains of Achaea and the kings. Now tell me, Muse, who were the bravest of them all, of the men and chariot-teams that came with Atreus' sons? The best by far of the teams were Eumelus' mares and Pheres' grandson drove them—swift as birds, matched in age and their glossy coats and matched to a builder's level flat across their backs. Phoebus Apollo lord of the silver bow had bred them both in Perea, a brace of mares that raced the War-god's panic through the lines. But best by far of the men was Telamonian Ajax while Achilles raged apart. The famed Achilles towered over them all, he and the battle-team that bore the peerless son of Peleus into war. But off in his beaked seagoing ships he lay, raging away at Atrides Agamemnon, king of armies, while his men sported along the surf, marking time, hurling the discus, throwing spears and testing bows. And the horses, each beside its chariot, champing clover and parsley from the marshes, waited, pawing idly. Their masters' chariots stood under blankets now, stored away in the tents while the rank and file, yearning for their leader, the great man of war, drifting here and there throughout the encampment, hung back from the fighting. But on the armies came as if the whole earth were devoured by wildfire, yes, and the ground thundered under them, deep as it does for Zeus who loves the lightning, Zeus in all his rage when he lashes the ground around Typhoeus in Arima, there where they say the monster makes his bed of pain- so the earth thundered under their feet, armies trampling, sweeping through the plain at blazing speed. Now the Trojans. Iris the wind-quick messenger hurried down to Ilium, bearing her painful message, sent by storming Zeus. The Trojans assembled hard by Priam's gates, gathered together there, young men and old, and rushing closer, racing Iris addressed them, keying her voice to that of Priam's son Polites. He had kept a watch for the Trojans, posted atop old Aesyetes' tomb and poised to sprint for home at the first sign of Argives charging from the ships. Like him to the life, the racing Iris urged, "Old Priam, words, endless words-that is your passion, always, as once in the days of peace. But ceaseless war's upon us! Time and again I've gone to battle, fought with men but I've never seen an army great as this. Too much- like piling leaves or sand, and on and on they come, advancing across the plain to fight before our gates. Hector, I urge you first of all-do as I tell you. Armies of allies crowd the mighty city of Priam, true, but they speak a thousand different tongues, fighters gathered here from all ends of the realm. Let each chief give commands to the tribe he leads, move them out, marshal his own contingents—now!" Hector missed nothing-that was a goddess' call. He broke up the assembly at once. They rushed to arms and all the gates flung wide and the Trojan mass surged out, horses, chariots, men on foot-a tremendous roar went up. Now a sharp ridge rises out in front of Troy, all on its own and far across the plain with running-room around it, all sides clear. Men call it Thicket Ridge, the immortals call it the leaping Amazon Myrine's mounded tomb, and there the Trojans and allies ranged their troops for battle. First, tall Hector with helmet flashing led the Trojans- Priam's son and in his command by far the greatest, bravest army, divisions harnessed in armor, veterans bristling spears. And the noble son of Anchises led the Dardanians- Aeneas whom the radiant Aphrodite bore Anchises down the folds of Ida, a goddess bedded with a man. Not Aeneas alone but flanked by Antenor's two sons, Acamas and Archelochus, trained for every foray. And men who lived in Zelea under the foot of Ida, a wealthy clan that drank the Aesepus' dark waters— Trojans all, and the shining son of Lycaon led them on, Pandarus, with the bow that came from Apollo's own hands. And the men who held the land of Apaesus and Adrestia, men who held Pityea, Terea's steep peaks—the units led by Adrestus joined by Amphius trim in linen corslet, the two good sons of Merops out of Percote harbor, Merops adept beyond all men in the mantic arts. He refused to let his two boys march to war, this man-killing war, but the young ones fought him all the way-the forces of black death drove them on. And the men who lived around Percote and Practios, men who settled Sestos, Abydos and gleaming Arisbe: Asius son of Hyrtacus led them on, captain of armies, Hyrtacus' offspring Asius-hulking, fiery stallions bore him in from Arisbe, from the Selleis River. Hippothous led the Pelasgian tribes of spearmen, fighters who worked Larissa's dark rich plowland. Hippothous and Pylaeus, tested soldier, led them on, both sons of Pelasgian Lethus, Teutamus' scion. Acamas and the old hero Pirous led the Thracians, all the Hellespont bounds within her riptide straits. Euphemus led the Cicones, fighters armed with spears, son of Troezenus, Ceas' son, a warlord bred by the gods. Pyraechmes led the Paeonians, reflex bows in hand, 960 hailing from Amydon far west and the broad river Axius, Axius, clearest stream that flows across the earth. That burly heart Pylaemenes led his Paphlagonians out of Enetian country, land where the wild mules breed: the men who held Cytorus and lived in range of Sesamus, building their storied halls along the Parthenius River, at Cromna, Aegialus and the highland fortress Erythini. Odius and Epistrophus led the Halizonians out of Alybe miles east where the mother lode of silver came to birth. Chromis led the Mysian men with Ennomus seer of birds- but none of his winged signs could beat off black death. Down he went, crushed by racing Achilles' hands, destroyed in the river where he slaughtered other Trojans too. Ascanius strong as a god and Phorcys led the Phrygians in from Ascania due east, primed for the clash of combat. Mesthles and Antiphus led Maeonia's proud contingent, Talaemenes' two sons sprung from the nymph of Gyge Lake led on Maeonian units born and bred under Mount Tmolus. Nastes led the Carians wild with barbarous tongues, men who held Miletus, Phthires' ridges thick with timber, Maeander's currents and Mount Mycale's craggy peaks. Amphimachus and Nastes led their formations on, Nastes and Amphimachus, Nomion's flamboyant sons. Nastes strolled to battle decked in gold like a girl, the fool! None of his trappings kept off grisly death- down he went, crushed by racing Achilles' hands, destroyed at the ford where battle-hard Achilles stripped his gold away. And last, Sarpedon and valiant Glaucus marched the Lycians on from Lycia far south, from the Xanthus' swirling rapids. Now with the squadrons marshaled, captains leading each, the Trojans came with cries and the din of war like wildfowl when the long hoarse cries of cranes sweep on against the sky and the great formations flee from winter's grim ungodly storms, flying in force, shrieking south to the Ocean gulfs, speeding blood and death to the Pygmy warriors, launching at daybreak savage battle down upon their heads. But Achaea's armies came on strong in silence, breathing combat-fury, hearts ablaze to defend each other to the death. When the South Wind showers mist on the mountaintops, no friend to shepherds, better than night to thieves- you can see no farther than you can fling a stone- so dust came clouding, swirling up from the feet of armies marching at top speed, trampling through the plain. Now closer, closing, front to front in the onset till Paris sprang from the Trojan forward ranks, a challenger, lithe, magnificent as a god, the skin of a leopard slung across his shoulders, a reflex bow at his back and battle-sword at hip and brandishing two sharp spears tipped in bronze he strode forth, challenging all the Argive best to fight him face-to-face in mortal combat. Soon as the warrior Menelaus marked him, Paris parading there with his big loping strides, flaunting before the troops, Atrides thrilled like a lion lighting on some handsome carcass, lucky to find an antlered stag or wild goat just as hunger strikes-he rips it, bolts it down, even with running dogs and lusty hunters rushing him. So Menelaus thrilled at heart-princely Paris there, right before his eyes. The outlaw, the adulterer ... "Now for revenge!" he thought, and down he leapt from his chariot fully armed and hit the ground. But soon as magnificent Paris marked Atrides shining among the champions, Paris' spirit shook. Backing into his friendly ranks, he cringed from death as one who trips on a snake in a hilltop hollow recoils, suddenly, trembling grips his knees and pallor takes his cheeks and back he shrinks. So he dissolved again in the proud Trojan lines, dreading Atrides-magnificent, brave Paris. At one glance Hector raked his brother with insults, stinging taunts: "Paris, appalling Paris! Our prince of beauty- mad for women, you lure them all to ruin! Would to god you'd never been born, died unwed. That's all I'd ask. Better that way by far than to have you strutting here, an outrage- a mockery in the eyes of all our enemies. Why, the long-haired Achaeans must be roaring with laughter! They thought you the bravest champion we could field, and just because of the handsome luster on your limbs, but you have no pith, no fighting strength inside you. What?-is this the man who mustered the oarsmen once, who braved the seas in his racing deep-sea ships, trafficked with outlanders, carried off a woman far from her distant shores, a great beauty wed to a land of rugged spearmen? You... curse to your father, your city and all your people, a joy to our enemies, rank disgrace to yourselfl So, you can't stand up to the battling Menelaus? You'd soon feel his force, that man you robbed of his sumptuous, warm wife. No use to you then, the fine lyre and these, these gifts of Aphrodite, your long flowing locks and your striking looks, not when you roll and couple with the dust. What cowards, the men of Troy-or years ago they'd have decked you out in a suit of rocky armor, stoned you to death for all the wrongs you've done!" And Paris, magnificent as a god, replied, "Ah Hector, you criticize me fairly, yes, nothing unfair, beyond what I deserve. The heart inside you is always tempered hard, like an ax that goes through wood when a shipwright cuts out ship timbers with every ounce of skill and the blade's weight drives the man's stroke. So the heart inside your chest is never daunted. Still, don't fling in my face the lovely gifts of golden Aphrodite. Not to be tossed aside, the gifts of the gods, those glories ... whatever the, gods give of their own free will- how could we ever choose them for ourselves? Now, though, if you really want me to fight to the finish here, have all Trojans and Argives take their seats and pit me against Menelaus dear to Ares- right between the lines- we'll fight it out for Helen and all her wealth. And the one who proves the better man and wins, he'll take those treasures fairly, lead the woman home. The rest will seal in blood their binding pacts of friendship. Our people will live in peace on the rich soil of Troy, our enemies sail home to the stallion-land of Argos, the land of Achaea where the women are a wonder. .." When Hector heard that challenge he rejoiced and right in the no man's land along his lines he strode, gripping his spear mid-haft, staving men to a standstill. But the long-haired Argive archers aimed at Hector, trying to cut him down with arrows, hurling rocks till King Agamemnon cried out in a ringing voice, "Hold back, Argives! Sons of Achaea, stop your salvos! Look, Hector with that flashing helmet of his— the man is trying to tell us something now. They held their attack. Quickly men fell silent and Hector pleaded, appealing to both armed camps: "Hear me—Trojans, Achaeans geared for combat! Hear the challenge of Paris, the man who caused our long hard campaign. He urges all the Trojans, all the Argives too, to lay their fine armor down on the fertile earth while Paris himself and the warrior Menelaus take the field between you and fight it out for Helen and all her wealth in single combat. And the one who proves the better man and wins, he'll take those treasures fairly, lead the woman home. The rest will seal in blood their binding pacts of friendship." He stopped. A hushed silence held the ranks. And Menelaus whose cry could marshal armies urged both sides, "Now hear me out as well! Such limited vengeance hurts me most of all- but I intend that we will part in peace, at last, Trojans and Achaeans. Look what heavy casualties you have suffered just for me, my violent quarrel, and Paris who brought it on you all. Now we'll fight- and death to the one marked out for doom and death! But the rest will part in peace, and soon, soon. Bring two lambs-a white male and a black ewe for the Sun and Earth-and we'll bring a third for Zeus. And lead on Priam too, Priam in all his power, so the king himself can seal our truce in blood- his royal sons are reckless, not to be trusted: no one must trample on the oath we swear to Zeus. The minds of the younger men are always flighty, but let an old man stand his ground among them, one who can see the days behind, the days ahead- that is the best hope for peace, for both our armies." The Achaean and Trojan forces both exulted, hoping this would end the agonies of war. They hauled their chariots up in ranks, at rest, the troops dismounted and stripped away their arms and laid them down on the earth, crowded together- hardly a foot of plowland showed between them. Back to the city Hector sent two heralds now to bring the lambs at once and summon Priam while King Agamemnon sent Talthybius off, heading down to the ships for one more lamb. The herald obeyed his captain's orders quickly. And now a messenger went to white-anned Helen too, Iris, looking for all the world like Hector's sister wed to Antenor's son, Helicaon's bride Laodice, the loveliest daughter Priam ever bred. And Iris came on Helen in her rooms ... weaving a growing web, a dark red folding robe, working into the weft the endless bloody struggles stallion-breaking Trojans and Argives armed in bronze had suffered all for her at the god of battle's hands. Iris, racing the wind, brushed close and whispered, "Come, dear girl, come quickly- so you can see what wondrous things they're doing, stallion-breaking Trojans and Argives armed in bronze! A moment ago they longed to kill each, other, longed for heartbreaking, inhuman warfare on the plain. Now those very warriors stand at ease, in silence- the fighting's stopped, they lean against their shields, their long lances stuck in the ground beside them. Think of it: Paris and Menelaus loved by Ares go to fight it out with their rugged spears- all for you-and the man who wins that duel, you'll be called his wife!" And with those words the goddess filled her heart with yearning warm and deep for her husband long ago, her city and her parents. Quickly cloaking herself in shimmering linen, out of her rooms she rushed, live tears welling, and not alone-two of her women followed close behind, Aethra, Pittheus' daughter, and Clymene, eyes wide, and they soon reached the looming Scaean Gates. And there they were, gathered around Priam, Panthous and Thymoetes, Lampus and Clytius, Hicetaon the gray aide of Ares, then those two with unfailing good sense, Ucalegon and Antenor. The old men of the realm held seats above the gates. Long years had brought their fighting days to a halt but they were eloquent speakers still, clear as cicadas settled on treetops, lifting their voices through the forest, rising softly, falling, dying away ... So they waited, the old chiefs of Troy, as they sat aloft the tower. And catching sight of Helen moving along the ramparts, they murmured one to another, gentle, winged words: "Who on earth could blame them? Ah, no wonder the men of Troy and Argives under arms have suffered years of agony all for her, for such a woman. Beauty, terrible beauty! A deathless goddess-so she strikes our eyes! But still, ravishing as she is, let her go home in the long ships and not be left behind ... for us and our children down the years an irresistible sorrow." They murmured low but Priam, raising his voice, called across to Helen, "Come over here, dear child. Sit in front of me, so you can see your husband of long ago, your kinsmen and your people. I don't blame you. I hold the gods to blame. They are the ones who brought this war upon me, devastating war against the Achaeans— Here, come closer, tell me the name of that tremendous fighter. Look, who's that Achaean there, so stark and grand? Many others afield are much taller, true, but I have never yet set eyes on one so regal, so majestic ... That man must be a king!" And Helen the radiance of women answered Priam, "I revere you so, dear father, dread you too— if only death had pleased me then, grim death, that day I followed your son to Troy, forsaking my marriage bed, my kinsmen and my child, my favorite, now full-grown, and the lovely comradeship of women my own age. Death never came, so now I can only waste away in tears. But about your question—yes, I have the answer. That man is Atreus' son Agamemnon, lord of empires, both a mighty king and a strong spearman too, and he used to be my kinsman, whore that I am! There was a world . . . or was it all a dream?" Her voice broke but the old king, lost in wonder; cried out, "How lucky you are, son of'Atreus, child of fortune, your destiny so blessed! Look at the vast Achaean armies you command! Years ago I visited Phrygia rife with vineyards, saw the Phrygian men with their swarming horses there- multitudes—the armies of Otreus, Mygdon like a god, encamped that time along the Sangarius River banks. And I took my stand among them, comrade-in-arms the day the Amazons struck, a match for men in war. But not even those hordes could match these hordes of yours, your fiery-eyed Achaeans!" And sighting Odysseus next the old king questioned Helen, "Come, dear child, tell me of that one too-now who is he? Shorter than Atreus' son Agamemnon, clearly, but broader across the shoulders, through the chest. There, you see? His armor's heaped on the green field but the man keeps ranging the ranks of fighters like a ram- yes, he looks to me like a thick-fleeced bellwether ram making his way through a big mass of sheep-flocks, shining silver-gray." Helen the child of Zeus replied, "That's Laertes' son, the great tactician Odysseus. He was bred in the land of Ithaca. Rocky ground and he's quick at every treachery under the sun- the man of twists and turns." Helen paused and the shrewd Antenor carried on her story: "Straight to the point, my lady, very true. Once in the past he came our way, King Odysseus heading the embassy they sent for your release, together with Menelaus dear to Ares. I hosted them, treated them warmly in my halls and learned the ways of both, their strategies, their traits. Now, when they mingled with our Trojans in assembly, standing side-by-side, Menelaus' shoulders mounted over his friend's in height and spread, when both were seated Odysseus looked more lordly. But when they spun their appeals before us all, Menelaus spoke out quickly-his words racing, few but clear as a bell, nothing long-winded or off the mark, though in fact the man was younger. But when Odysseus sprang up, the famed tactician would just stand there, staring down, hard, his eyes fixed on the ground, never shifting his scepter back and forth, clutching it stiff and still like a mindless man. You'd think him a sullen fellow or just plain fool. But when he let loose that great voice from. his chest and the words came piling on like a driving winter blizzard- then no man alive could rival Odysseus! Odysseus ... we no longer gazed in wonder at his looks." Catching sight of a third fighter, Ajax, the old king asked her next, "Who's that other Achaean, so powerful, so well-built? He towers over the Argives, his head, his massive shoulders!" And Helen in all her radiance, her long robes, replied, "Why, that's the giant Ajax, bulwark of the Achaeans. And Idomeneus over there-standing with his Cretans- like a god, you see? And the Cretan captains form a ring around him. How often Menelaus, my good soldier, would host him in our halls, in the old days, when he'd sail across from Crete. And now I see them all, the fiery-eyed Achaeans, I know them all by heart, and I could tell their names ... but two I cannot find, and they're captains of the armies, Castor breaker of horses and the hardy boxer Polydeuces. My blood brothers. Mother bore them both. Perhaps they never crossed over from Lacedaemon's lovely hills or come they did, sailing here in the deep-sea ships, but now they refuse to join the men in battle, dreading the scorn, the curses hurled at me . . ." So she wavered, but the earth already held them fast, long dead in the life-giving earth of Lacedaemon, the dear land of their fathers. Now through Troy the heralds brought the offerings for the gods, sacred victims to bind and seal the oaths: two lambs and the wine that warms the heart, the yield of the vine, filling a goatskin sack, and the herald Idaeus carried a gleaming bowl and golden winecups. Reaching the old king's side the crier roused him sharply: "Son of Laomedon, rise up! They are calling for you now, commanders of both armies, stallion-breaking Trojans and Argives armed in bronze- come down to the plain so you can seal our oaths. Now Paris and Menelaus, Atrides loved by Ares, will fight it out with their rugged spears for Helen, and Helen and all her treasures go to the man who wins. The rest will seal in blood their binding pacts of friendship. Our people will live in peace on the rich soil of Troy. Our enemies sail home to the stallion-land of Argos, the land of Achaea where the women are a wonder." A shudder went shooting through the old man but he told his men to yoke the team at once. They promptly obeyed and Priam climbed aboard, pulling the reins back taut. Anterior flanked him, mounting the gleaming car, and both men drove the team through the Scaean Gates, heading toward the plain. Reaching the front, they climbed down from the chariot, onto the earth that feeds us all, and into the space between Achaean and Trojan lines they marched, Lord Agamemnon rose at once to greet them both with the great tactician Odysseus by his side. The noble heralds brought on the victims marked for the gods to seal and bind the oaths. They mixed the contenders' wine in a large bowl and rinsed the warlords' waiting hands with water. Atreus' son drew forth the dagger always slung at his battle-sword's big sheath, cut some tufts from the lambs' heads, and heralds passed them round to Achaean and Trojan captains. Then Atreus' son Agamemnon stood in behalf of all, lifted his arms and prayed in his deep resounding voice, "Father Zeus! Ruling over us all from Ida, god of greatness, god of glory Helios, Sun above us, you who see all, hear all things! Rivers! And Earth! And you beneath the ground who punish the dead—whoever broke his oath- be witness here, protect our binding pacts. If Paris brings Menelaus down in blood, he keeps Helen himself and all her wealth and we sail home in our racing deep-sea ships. But if red-haired Menelaus brings down Paris, the Trojans surrender Helen and all her treasures. And they pay us reparations fair and fitting, a price to inspire generations still to come. But if Priam and Priam's sons refuse to pay, refuse me, Agamemnon-with Paris beaten down- then I myself will fight it out for the ransom, I'll battle here to the end of our long war." On those terms he dragged his ruthless dagger across the lambs' throats and let them fall to the ground, dying, gasping away their life breath, cut short by the sharp bronze. Then dipping up the wine from the mixing bowls, brimming their cups, pouring them on the earth, men said their prayers to the gods who never die. You could hear some Trojan or Achaean calling, "Zeus- god of greatness, god of glory, all you immortals! Whichever contenders trample on this treaty first, spill their brains on the ground as this wine spills- theirs, their children's too-their enemies rape their wives!" But Zeus would not fulfill their prayers, not yet ... Now Priam rose in their midst and took his leave: "Hear me, Trojans, Achaeans geared for combat- home I go to windy Ilium, straight home now. This is more than I can bear, I tell you- to watch my son do battle with Menelaus loved by the War-god, right before my eyes. Zeus knows, no doubt, and every immortal too, which fighter is doomed to end all this in death." And laying the victims in the chariot, noble Priam climbed aboard, pulling the reins back taut. Antenor flanked him, mounting the gleaming car, and back they drove again, heading home to Troy. But Priam's son Prince Hector and royal Odysseus measured off the ground for single combat first, then dropped two stones in a helmet, lots for casting- who would be first to hurl his bronze-tipped spear? The armies prayed and stretched their hands to the gods. You could hear some Trojan or Achaean pleading, "Father Zeusl Ruling over us all from Ida, god of greatness, gloryl Whoever brought this war on both our countries, let him rot and sink to the House of Death— but let our pacts of friendship all hold fast!" So they prayed as tall Hector, eyes averted under his flashing helmet, shook the two lots hard and Paris' lot leapt out. The troops sat down by rank, each beside his horses pawing the ground where blazoned war-gear lay. And now- one warrior harnessed burnished armor on his back, magnificent Paris, fair-haired Helen's consort. First he wrapped his legs with well-made greaves, fastened behind the heels with silver ankle-clasps, next he strapped a breastplate round his chest, his brother Lycaon's that fitted him so well. Then over his shoulder Paris slung his sword, the fine bronze blade with its silver-studded hilt, and then the shield-strap and his sturdy, massive shield and over his powerful head he set a well-forged helmet, the horsehair crest atop it tossing, bristling terror, and last he grasped a spear that matched his grip. Following step by step the fighting Menelaus strapped on armor too. Both men armed at opposing sides of the forces, into the no man's land between the lines they strode, glances menacing, wild excitement seizing all who watched, the stallion-breaking Trojans and Argive men-at-arms. Striking a stand in the dueling-ground just cleared they brandished spears at each other, tense with fury. Suddenly Paris hurled-his spear's long shadow flew and the shaft hit Menelaus' round shield, full center- not pounding through, the brazen point bent back in the tough armor. But his turn next—Menelaus reared with a bronze lance and a prayer to Father Zeus: "Zeus, King, give me revenge, he wronged me first! Illustrious Paris-crush him under my hand! So even among the men to come a man may shrink from wounding the host who showers him with kindness." Shaking his spear, he hurled and its long shadow flew and the shaft hit Paris' round shield, hit full center- straight through the gleaming hide the heavy weapon drove, ripping down and in through the breastplate finely worked, tearing the war-shirt, close by Paris' flank it jabbed but the Trojan swerved aside and dodged black death. So now Menelaus drew his sword with silver studs and hoisting the weapon high, brought it crashing down on the helmet ridge but the blade smashed where it struck- jagged shatters flying-it dropped from Atrides' hand and the hero cried out, scanning the blank skies, "Father Zeus-no god's more deadly than you! Here I thought I'd punish Paris for all his outrage- now my sword is shattered, right in my hands, look, my spear flew from my grip for nothing-I never hit him!" Lunging at Paris, he grabbed his horsehair crest, swung him round, started to drag him into Argive lines and now the braided chin-strap holding his helmet tight was gouging his soft throat-Paris was choking, strangling. Now he'd have hauled him off and won undying glory but Aphrodite, Zeus's daughter quick to the mark, snapped the rawhide strap, cut from a bludgeoned ox, and the helmet came off empty in Menelaus' fist. Whirling it round the fighter sent it flying into his Argives scrambling fast to retrieve it- back at his man he sprang, enraged with brazen spear, mad for the kill but Aphrodite snatched Paris away, easy work for a god, wrapped him in swirls of mist and set him down in his bedroom filled with scent. Then off she went herself to summon Helen and found her there on the steep, jutting tower with a troop of Trojan women clustered round her. The goddess reached and tugged at her fragrant robe, whispering low, for all the world like an old crone, the old weaver who, when they lived in Lacedaemon, wove her fine woolens and Helen held her dear. Like her to the life, immortal Love invited, "Quickly-Paris is calling for you, come back homel There he is in the bedroom, the bed with inlaid rings- he's glistening in all his beauty and his robes! You'd never dream he's come from fighting a man, you'd think he's off to a dance or slipped away from the dancing, stretching out at ease." Enticing so that the heart in Helen's breast began to race. She knew the goddess at once, the long lithe neck, the smooth full breasts and the fire in those eyes- and she was amazed, she burst out with her name: "Maddening one, my Goddess, oh what now? Lusting to lure me to my ruin yet again? Where will you drive me next? Off and away to other grand, luxurious cities, out to Phrygia, out to Maeonia's tempting country? Have you a favorite mortal man there too? But why now?— because Menelaus has beaten your handsome Paris and hateful as I am, he longs to take me home? Is that why you beckon here beside me now with all the immortal cunning in your heart? Well, go to him yourself-you hover beside him! Abandon the gods' high road and be a mortal! Never set foot again on Mount Olympus, never!- suffer for Paris, protect Paris, for eternity ... until he makes you his wedded wife-that or his slave. Not I, I'll never go back again. It would be wrong, disgraceful to share that coward's bed once more. The women of Troy would scorn me down the years. Oh the torment—never-ending heartbreak!" But Aphrodite rounded on her in fury: "Don't provoke me-wretched, headstrong girl! Or in my immortal rage I may just toss you over, hate you as I adore you now-with a vengeance. I might make you the butt of hard, withering hate from both sides at once, Trojans and Achaeans- then your fate can tread you down to dust!" So she threatened and Helen the daughter of mighty Zeus was terrified. Shrouding herself in her glinting silver robes she went along, in silence. None of her women saw her go . . . The goddess led the way. And once they arrived at Paris' sumptuous halls the attendants briskly turned to their own work as Helen in all her radiance climbed the steps to the bedroom under the high, vaulting roof. There Aphrodite quickly brought her a chair, the goddess herself with her everlasting smile, and set it down, face-to-face with Paris. And there Helen sat, Helen the child of Zeus whose shield is storm and lightning, glancing away, lashing out at her husband: "So, home from the wars! Oh would to god you'd died there, brought down by that great soldier, my husband long ago. And how you used to boast, year in, year out, that you were the better man than fighting Menelaus in power, arm and spear! So why not go back now, hurl your challenge at Menelaus dear to Ares, fight it out together, man-to-man again? Wait, take my advice and call a halt right here: no more battling with fiery-haired Menelaus, pitting strength against strength in single combat- madness. He just might impale you on his spear!" But Paris replied at once to Helen's challenge: "No more, dear one-don't rake me with your taunts, myself and all my courage. This time, true, Menelaus has won the day, thanks to Athena. I'll bring him down tomorrow. Even we have gods who battle on our side. But come— let's go to bed, let's lose ourselves in love! Never has longing for you overwhelmed me so, no, not even then, I tell you, that first time when I swept you up from the lovely hills of Lacedaemon, sailed you off and away in the racing deep-sea ships and we went and locked in love on Rocky Island ... That was nothing to how I hunger for you now- irresistible longing lays me low!" He led the way to bed. His wife went with him. And now, while the two made love in the large carved bed, Menelaus stalked like a wild beast, up and down the lines- where could he catch a glimpse of magnificent Paris? Not a single Trojan, none of their famous allies could point out Paris to battle-hungry Menelaus. Not that they would hide him out of friendship, even if someone saw him— all of them hated him like death, black death. But marshal Agamemnon called out to the armies, "Hear me now, you Trojans, Dardans, Trojan allies! Clearly victory goes to Menelaus dear to Ares. You must surrender Helen and all her treasures with her. At once-and pay us reparations fair and fitting, A price to inspire generations still to come!” So Atrides demanded. His armies roared assent. Now aloft by the side of Zeus the gods sat in council, conferring across Olympus' golden floor as noble Hebe poured them rounds of nectar. They lifted golden beakers, pledging each other warmly, gazing down on Troy ... But abruptly Zeus was set on infuriating Hera, courting her fire with cunning, mocking taunts: "So, those two goddesses there are Menelaus' best defense, Hera of Argos, Boeotian Athena, guard of armies. Look at them—sitting apart, watching the dueling. So they take their pleasure. But Aphrodite here with her everlasting laughter always stands by Paris and drives the deadly spirits from her man. Why, just now she plucked him away, she saved his life when he thought his end had come. Nevertheless- clearly victory goes to Menelaus dear to Ares. So now we plan how the war will all work out: do we rouse the pain and grisly fighting once again or hand down pacts of peace between both armies? Ah if only it might prove well and good to all, to every immortal god, men might still live on in royal Priam's citadel. And Helen of Argos? Menelaus just might lead her home again." So he mocked as Athena and Queen Hera muttered between themselves, huddled together, plotting Troy's destruction. True, Athena held her peace and said nothing .. . smoldering at the Father, seized with wild resentment. But Hera could hold the anger in her breast no longer, suddenly bursting out, "Dread majesty, son of Cronus, what are you saying? How can you think of making all my labor worthless, all gone for nothing? Mortal labor-the sweat I poured, my horses panting, spent from launching Achaea's armies, heaping pains on Priam and Priam's sons. Do as you please— but none of the deathless gods will ever praise you." Rising in anger, Zeus who drives the storm clouds thundered, "Insatiable Heral How great are the pains that Priam and Priam's sons have heaped on you that you rage on, relentless, forever bent on razing the well-built heights of Troy? Only if you could breach their gates and their long walls and devour Priam and Priam's sons and the Trojan armies raw- then you just might cure your rage at last. Well, do as you please. But in days to come don't let this quarrel breed some towering clash between us both, pitting you and me in conflict. One more thing-take it to heart, I urge you. Whenever I am bent on tearing down some city filled with men you love-to please myself- never attempt to thwart my fury, Hera, give me my way. For 1, 1 gave you this, all of my own free will but hardly willing. No, of all the cities under the sun and starry skies, wherever men who walk the earth have dwelled, I honor sacred Ilium most with my immortal heart: Priam and men of Priam who hurls the strong ash spear. Never once did my altar lack its share of victims, winecups tipped and the deep smoky savor. These, these are the gifts we claim-they are our rights." And Hera the Queen, her eyes wide, answered, "Excellent! The three cities that I love best of all are Argos and Sparta, Mycenae with streets as broad as Troy's. Raze them—whenever they stir the hatred in your heart. My cities . . . I will never rise in their defense, not against you—I'd never grudge your pleasure. What if I did protest, forbid you to raze their walls? What good would protest do? You are far stronger than I. Still, you must not make my labor come to nothing. I am a god too. My descent the same as yours- crooked-minded Cronus fathered me as well, the first of all his daughters, first both ways: both by birth and since I am called your consort and you in turn rule all the immortal gods. So come, let us yield to each other now on this one point, I to you and you to me, and the other deathless powers will fall in line. But quickly, order Athena down to battle now, into the killing-ground of Trojans and Achaeans— and see that the Trojans break the sworn truce first and trample on the Argives in their triumph!" The father of men and gods complied at once. He winged Athena on with a flight of orders: "Quickly! Down you go to Troy's.and Achaea's armies now- and see that the Trojans break the sworn truce first and trample on the Argives in their triumph." So he launched Athena already poised for action. Down the goddess swept from Olympus' craggy peaks and dove like a star the son of Cronus flings, Cronus with all his turning, twisting ways- a sign to men at sea or a massive army marching, blazing on with a stream of sparks showering in its wake. Like a shooting star Athena flashed across the earth, plunging down in the midst of both camped forces. Terror gripped the fighters looking on, stallion-breaking Trojans, Argive men-at-arms. One would glance at a comrade, groaning, "What next- battle again, more pain and grisly fighting? Or pacts between both armies? Peace from Zeus, the great steward on high who rules our mortal wars?" As Achaeans and Trojans wondered what was coming, Athena merged in the Trojan columns like a fighter, like Antenor's son the rugged spearman Laodocus, hunting for Pandarus, hoping to find the archer. Find him she did, Lycaon's skilled, fearless son, standing by, flanked by the bands of shielded men who'd trooped with him from Aesepus' dark rapids. Athena halted beside him, let her challenge fly: "Here's glory, son of Lycaon-let me tempt you, you with your archer's skill! Have you the daring to wing an arrow at Menelaus? Just think what thanks, what fame you'd win in the eyes of all the Trojans, Prince Paris most of all. The first among all, you'd bear off shining, priceless gifts from him. Just let him see Menelaus, Atreus' fighting son brought down by your shaft and hoisted onto his pyre, mourned with grief and tears! Come, up with you, whip an arrow at this invincible Menelaus-now! But swear to Apollo, Wolf-god, glorious Archer, you'll slaughter splendid victims, newborn lambs when you march home to Zelea's sacred city." So Athena fired the fool's heart inside him. Then and there he unstrapped his polished bow, the horn of a wild goat he'd shot in the chest one day as the springy ibex clambered down a cliff. Lurking there under cover, he hit it in the heart and the fine kill went sprawling down the rocks. The horns on its head ran sixteen hands in length and a bowyer good with goat-horn worked them up, fitted, clasped them tight, sanded them smooth and set the golden notch-rings at the tips. Superb equipment-bending it back hard the archer strung his bow ... propping an end against the ground as cohorts braced their shields in a tight wedge to hide him, fearing bands of Argives might just leap to their feet before he could hit Menelaus, Atreus' fighting son. He flipped the lid of his quiver, plucked an arrow fletched and never shot, a shaft of black pain. Quickly notching the sharp arrow on the string he swore to Apollo, Wolf-god, glorious Archer, he'd slaughter splendid victims, newborn lambs when he marched home to Zelea's sacred city. Squeezing the nock and string together, drawing the gut back to his nipple, iron head to the handgrip till he flexed the great weapon back in a half-circle curve- the bow sprang! the string sang out, arrow shot away razor-sharp and raging to whip through Argive ranks! But you, Menelaus, the blessed deathless gods did not forget you, Zeus's daughter the queen of fighters first of all. She reared before you, skewed the tearing shaft, flicking it off your skin as quick as a mother flicks a fly from her baby sleeping softly. Athena's own hand deflected it down the belt where the gold buckles clasp and breastplates overlap. The shaft pierced the tight belt's twisted thongs, piercing the blazoned plates, piercing the guard he wore to shield his loins and block the spears, his best defense-the shaft pierced even this, the tip of the weapon grazing the man's flesh, and dark blood came spurting from the wound. Picture a woman dyeing ivory blood red ... a Carian or Maeonian staining a horse's cheekpiece, and it's stored away in a vault and troops of riders long to sport the ornament, true, but there it lies as a king's splendor, kept and prized twice over- his team's adornment, his driver's pride and glory. So now, Menelaus, the fresh blood went staining down your sturdy thighs, your shins and well-turned ankles. The lord of men Agamemnon shuddered, frightened to see the dark blood gushing from the wound. And veteran Menelaus cringed himself but saw the lashing-cords and barbs outside the gash and his courage flooded back inside his chest. Nevertheless, King Agamemnon, groaning heavily, grasped Menelaus' hand and spoke out for the men as friends around him groaned as well: "Dear brother- that truce I sealed in blood was death for you, setting you out alone ... exposed before our lines to fight the Trojans- Look how the men of Troy have laid you low, trampling down our solemn, binding truce! But they will never go for nothing, the oaths, the blood of the lambs, the unmixed wine we poured, the firm clasp of the right hand we trusted. Never— even if Zeus's wrath does not strike home at once, he'll strike in his own good time with greater fury. Transgressors will pay the price, a tremendous price, with their own heads, their wives and all their children. Yes, for in my heart and soul I know this well: the day will come when sacred Troy must die, Ptfam must die and all his people with him, Priam who hurls the strong ash spear! The son of Cronus, Zeus, throned aloft in the heavens where he lives, Zeus himself will brandish over their heads his black storm-shield, enraged at their deceit. Nothing can stop it now. All this will come to pass. But I will suffer terrible grief for you, Menelaus, if you die now, if you fill out your destiny now- and I go back to parching Argos in disgrace. For the men will turn their minds toward home at once, and we must leave Priam and all the men of Troy a trophy to glory over, Helen, queen of Argos ... But the plowland here will rot your bones, my brother, as you lie dead in Troy, your mission left unfinished. Then some Trojan will glory, swaggering, arrogant, leaping down on the grave of famous Menelaus: 'Let Agamemnon wreak his anger so on all his foesl Just as he led his armies here for nothing, failure. Now home he's gone to the dear land of his fathers, his warships empty, leaving behind the hero Menelaus moldering in his wake!' So some Trojan will trumpet— let the great earth gape and take me down that day!" But the red-haired Menelaus tried to calm him: "Courage. Don't alarm the men, not for a moment. The point's not lodged in a mortal spot, you see? My glittering war-belt stopped the shot in front, my loin-piece and the plated guard below it, gear the bronzesmiths hammered out for me." And marshal Agamemnon took his lead: "Pray god you're right, dear brother Menelaus! But the wound-a healer will treat it, apply drugs and put a stop to the black waves of pain." Agamemnon turned to the sacred herald: "Quick, Talthybius. Call Machaon here, the son of Asclepius, that unfailing healer, to see to Menelaus, Atreus' fighting son. An archer's hit him, a good hand at the bow, some Trojan or some Lycian-all glory to him, a heavy blow to us." The herald obeyed at once. He ran through ranks of Achaeans armed in bronze, searching for brave Machaon. Find him he did, standing by, flanked by the bands of shielded men who'd trooped with him from the stallion-land of Tricca. He halted beside him there and let his message fly: "Quickly, son of Asclepius, King Agamemnon calls! Now see to Menelaus, Achaea's fighting captain. An archer's hit him, a good hand at the bow, some Trojan or some Lycian-all glory to him, a heavy blow to us!" So the herald shouted, stirring Machaon's spirit. Back the two men ran through crowds of troops in Achaea's vast encampment. And gaining the place where red-haired Menelaus nursed his wound and a growing ring of warlords pressed around him, striding into their midst the godsent healer reached the captain's side and quickly drew the shaft from his buckled belt- he pulled it clear, the sharp barbs broke back. He loosed the glittering belt and slipped it off and the loin-piece and the plated guard below it, gear the bronzesmiths made. When he saw the wound where the tearing arrow hit, he sucked out the blood and deftly applied the healing salves that Chiron, friend of Asclepius, gave his father long ago. And all the while they worked over Menelaus whose cry could marshal armies, on the Trojans came, columns armed for assault, and again the Argives donned their gear and roused their lust for war. King Agamemnon's hour. You would not find him asleep, not cringing a moment, hanging back from the struggle- he pressed for battle now where men win glory. He left his team and burnished bronze car with an aide, Eurymedon, Ptolemaeus PiraIdes' son reining off to the side his snorting pair of stallions. He gave him strict orders to keep them close at hand for the time his knees might buckle with fatigue from bringing crowds of soldiers into line. Then out he went on foot to range the ranks. The charioteers he spotted, fast with teams, he'd halt beside and spur them on: "My Argives, never relax your nerve, your fighting strength! Father Zeus, I swear, will never defend the Trojans, liars—they were the first to trample on their oaths. So vultures will eat them raw, their firm young flesh, and we, we'll drag their dear wives and helpless children back to the beaked ships, once we've seized, their city!" But any men he saw retreating from hateful battle he would lash with a sharp burst of rage: "You Argives- glorious braggarts! Disgraces-have you no shame? Just standing there, dumbstruck like fawns done in from hightailing over some big meadow, winded and teetering, heart inside them spent. Standing there dazed, your fighting spirit dead- what are you waiting for? You want these Trojans to pin you against your high stems beached in the surf? To see if Zeus will stretch his hands above your heads and save your craven lives?" So the commander ranged Achaea's ranks and brought them into line. Moving on through the crowds he found the Cretans arming for combat now, ringing brave Idomeneus. Strong as a boar he urged his frontline troops as Meriones brought the rear battalions up. King Agamemnon, thrilled to watch them work, was quick to salute the chief and sing his praises: "You are the one I prize, Idomeneus, more than all our Argive fighters fast with chariot-teams- whether in war or action of any sort or feasts where the ranking Argive warlords mix their bowls with the shining wine of kings. What if the rest of all the long-haired Achaeans drink their measure off? Your cup stands filled, always, brimmed like mine when the will stirs you to drink- so now drink deep of battle. Be that fighter you claimed to be in all the years gone by." The Cretan captain Idomeneus answered warmly, "Trust me, Atrides—count on me, your comrade, staunch as I swore at first, that day I bowed my head. Now fire up the rest of your long-haired Achaeans. On with the fighting, quickly! The Trojans broke our binding truce just now- death and grief to the men of Troy hereafter! They were the first to trample on our pact." Hearing that, the son of Atreus strode on. Elated and making way through crowds of troops he found the two called Ajax, Great and Little, both captains armed for attack with a cloud of infantry forming up behind them. Think how a goatherd off on a mountain lookout spots a storm cloud moving down the sea ... bearing down beneath the rush of the West Wind and miles away he sees it building black as pitch, blacker, whipping the whitecaps, full hurricane fury- the herdsman shudders to see it, drives his flocks to a cave- so dense the battalions grouped behind the two Aeantes, packed, massed with hardy fighters dear to the gods, battalions black and bristling shields and spears, fighters sweeping into the breaking storm of war. And King Agamemnon, thrilled to see that sight, sped them on with a rousing flight of praises: "Ajax-Ajax! Chiefs of the Argives armed in bronze, no orders for you-it's wrong to incite you two, you lead your men to war in so much force. Father Zeus, Athena, Apollo, if all my fighters had such courage pounding inside their chests, we'd bring King Priam's citadel crashing down in an instant, sacked at our hands—annihilated." He spun on his heels and left them there in place, heading for other ranks and came on Nestor next, the clear speaker of Pylos posting troops, readying them for action, combat units forming under the lanky Pelagon, Alastor and Chromius, Haemon and stocky Bias, skilled captain of armies. Forward he ranged the charioteers with teams and cars, backed by infantry close behind them, milling, brave men, the defensive line of battle-that would be their role. But the known cowards he drove amidst the center: a man might cringe but he'd be forced to fight. And first he gave his drivers strict commands to rein their teams back hard and never panic, no fouling them in the onslaught: "Let no man, so sure of his horsemanship and soldier's prowess, dare to fight it out alone with the Trojans, exposed in front of his lines. No heroics now! But give no ground-the charge will go to pieces. And any charioteer who reaches Trojan chariots, thrust your spear from your own car, don't throw it! Better that way—it's tighter, stronger fighting. So men before your time stormed walls and cities, holding fast to that tactic, warring on with heart." The old soldier spurring his men with skills from a lifetime spent campaigning, battles long ago. And King Agamemnon, thrilled to see his efforts, cheered him on with a flight of praise: "Old war-horse, if only your knees could match the spirit in your chest and your body's strength were planted firm as rock, but the great leveler, age, has wom you down. If only some other fighter had your years and you could march with the younger, fitter men!" And Nestor the seasoned charioteer replied, "True, Atrides, if only I were the man I was, years ago, when I cut down rugged Ereuthalion ... but the gods won't give us all their gifts at once. If I was a young man then, now old age dogs my steps. Nevertheless, I'll still troop with the horsemen, give them maneuvers, discipline and commands: that is the right and pride of us old men. The young spearmen will do the work with spears. Younger than Nestor, the next generation up, flush with their fresh strength." So Nestor said and Atrides ranged forward, glad at heart, and came on Peteos' son the charioteer Menestheus standing idle, and circling him Athenian men who could raise the cry of battle. And there beside them the great tactician Odysseus, drawn up with his Cephallenians grouped around him, bands of them, no mean fighters, watching, waiting. The call to action had still not reached their ears and the columns were only just now forming, moving out, stallion-breaking Trojans and long lines of Achaeans. So the Cephallenians held their ground there, poised .. . when would some other Argive unit make its charge, engage the Trojan front and open up in battle? Spotting them now the lord of men Agamemnon dressed them down with a winging burst of scorn: "You there, Peteos' son, a king, dear to the gods! And you, the captain of craft and cunning, shrewd with greed! Why are you cowering here, skulking out of range? Waiting for others 'to do your fighting for you? You-it's your duty to stand in the front ranks and take your share of the scorching blaze of battle. First you are, when you hear of feasts from me, when Achaeans set out banquets for the chiefs. Then you're happy enough to down the roast meats and cups of honeyed, mellow wine-all you can drink. But now you'd gladly watch ten troops of Achaeans beat you to this feast, first to fight with the ruthless bronze before you!" The great tactician Odysseus gave him a dark glance and shot back at once, "Now what's this, Atrides, this talk that slips through your clenched teeth? How can you say I hang back from the fighting when Argive units spur the slashing god of war against these Trojan horsemen? Just you watch, if you'll take the time and care to taste some action, watch Telemachus' loving father lock and fight with enemy champions, stallion-breaking Trojans. You and your bluster-you are talking nonsense!" smiled broadly and took back his taunts at once: "Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, great tactician, I must not bait you so beyond the limit . . . must not give you orders. I know for a fact the spirit in your heart is well-disposed to me and all my efforts. We see eye-to-eye. Come, we'll set these things to rights later- if any offense has passed between us now. May the gods make all our bluster come to nothing." He left him there in place, heading for other chiefs. And he came on Tydeus' son, impetuous Diomedes standing by in his bolted car behind his team with Sthenelus flanked beside him, Capaneus' son. And spotting Tydides there, field marshal Agamemnon gave him a winging burst of scorn: "What's this?- you, the son of Tydeus, that skilled breaker of horses? Why cringing here? Gazing out on the passageways of battle! That was never Tydeus' way, shy behind the lines he'd grapple enemies, bolting ahead of comrades. Or so they claim who watched him at his work. I never met the man myself, never saw him, but they say he had no equal. True enough, he came to Mycenae once but not at war with us- a guest, a friend, with the royal Polynices raising troops that time they geared to attack the holy walls of Thebes. They pressed us hard, they begged us to give them battle-tested allies. My kin were glad to oblige and grant them their requests- till Zeus changed our minds with a flash of bad omens. So off they went, getting some distance on their way and reached the Asopus' grassy banks and reedbeds. From that point the men sent Tydeus on ahead, bearing their message. He marched out at once and came on crowds, menacing bands of Thebans feasting away in the halls of mighty Eteocles. There, a total stranger, the horseman Tydeus had no fear, alone in the midst of Theban hordes. Undaunted, Tydeus challenged them all to tests of strength and beat them all with ease, in each event, Athena urged him on with so much winning force. But the Thebans rose in anger, lashed their teams arld packed an ambush to meet him heading back- full fifty fighters with two chiefs in the lead, Hunter the son of Bloodlust, strong as the gods, and Killerman's son, the gifted cutthroat Slaughter. But Tydeus treated them all to a shameful fate, finished them all but let one run for home, heeding the gods' signs he let the hunter off. Now there was a man, that Tydeus, that Aetolian. But he bore a son who's not the half of him in battle- better only in wrangling, wars of words!" Taunting so, and steadfast Diomedes offered no reply ... overawed by the king's majestic scorn. But Capaneus' headstrong son lashed back in style: "Don't lie, Atrides! You know the truth-say it! We claim we are far, far greater than our fathers. We are the ones who stormed the seven gates of Thebes, heading a weaker force and facing stronger walls but obeying the gods' signs and backed by Zeus. Our fathers? Fools. Their own bravado killed them. Don't tell me you rank our fathers with ourselves!" But resolute Diomedes gave him a dark glance: "Sit down, my friend, be quiet. Listen to me. I don't blame Agamemnon, our commander in chief, for goading his combat-ready Argives into battle. The glory goes to him if the Argive fighters lay the Trojans low and take their sacred city, but immense grief is his if comrades die in droves. Up now, rouse our fighting-fury!" With that challenge he sprang from his chariot fully armed and hit the ground. A terrific din of bronze rang from the captain's chest, striding toward attack. Fear would have gripped the staunchest man and made his knees give way. As a heavy surf assaults some roaring coast, piling breaker on breaker whipped by the West Wind, and out on the open sea a crest first rears its head then pounds down on the shore with hoarse, rumbling thunder and in come more shouldering crests, arching up and breaking against some rocky spit, exploding salt foam to the skies- so wave on wave they came, Achaean battalions ceaseless, surging on to war. Each captain ordered his men and the ranks moved on in silence ... You'd never think so many troops could march holding their voices in their chests, all silence, fearing their chiefs who called out clear commands, and the burnished blazoned armor round their bodies flared, the formations trampling on. But not the Trojans, no . . . like flocks of sheep in a wealthy rancher's steadings, thousands crowding to have their white milk drained, bleating nonstop when they hear their crying lambs- so the shouts rose up from the long Trojan lines and not one cry, no common voice to bind them all together, their tongues mixed and clashed, their men hailed from so many far-flung countries. Ares, drove them, fiery-eyed Athena drove the Argives, and Terror and Rout and relentless Strife stormed too, sister of manslaughtering Ares, Ares' comrade-in-arms- Strife, only a slight thing when she first rears her head but her head soon hits the sky as she strides across the earth. Now Strife hurled down the leveler Hate amidst both sides, wading into the onslaught, flooding men with pain. At last the armies clashed at one strategic point, they slammed their shields together, pike scraped pike with the grappling strength of fighters armed in bronze and their round shields pounded, boss on welded boss, and the sound of struggle roared and rocked the earth. Screams of men and cries of triumph breaking in one breath, fighters killing, fighters killed, and the ground streamed blood. Wildly as two winter torrents raging down from the mountains, swirling into a valley, hurl their great waters together, flash floods from the wellsprings plunging down in a gorge and miles away in the hills a shepherd hears the thunder- so from the grinding armies broke the cries and crash of war. Antilochus was the first to kill a Trojan captain, tough on the front lines, Thalysias' son Echepolus. Antilochus thrust first, speared the horsehair helmet right at the ridge, and the bronze spearpoint lodged in the man's forehead, smashing through his skull and the dark came whirling down across his eyes- he toppled down like a tower in the rough assault. As he fell the enormous Elephenor grabbed his feet, Chalcodon's son, lord of the brave-hearted Abantes, dragged him out from under the spears, rushing madly to strip his gear but his rush was short-lived. Just as he dragged that corpse the brave Agenor spied his ribs, bared by his shield as he bent low- Agenor stabbed with a bronze spear and loosed his limbs, his life spirit left him and over his dead body now the savage work went on, Achaeans and Trojans mauling each other there like wolves, leaping, hurtling into each other, man throttling man. And Telamonian Ajax struck Anthemion's son, the hardy stripling Simoisius, still unwed ... His mother had borne him along the Simois' banks when she trailed her parents down the slopes of Ida to tend their flocks, and so they called him Simoisius. But never would he repay his loving parents now for the gift of rearing-his life cut short so soon, brought down by the spear of lionhearted Ajax. At the first charge he slashed his right nipple, clean through the shoulder went the brazen point and down in the dust he fell like a lithe black poplar shot up tall and strong in the spreading marshy flats, the trunk trimmed but its head a shock of branches. A chariot-maker fells it with shining iron ax as timber to bend for handsome chariot wheels and there it lies, seasoning by the river .. . So lay Anthemion's son Simoisius, cut down by the giant royal Ajax. Antiphus hurled at him— the son of Priam wearing a gleaming breastplate let fly through the lines but his sharp spear missed and he hit Leucus instead, Odysseus' loyal comrade, gouging his groin as the man hauled off a corpse- it dropped from his hands and Leucus sprawled across it. Enraged at his friend's death Odysseus sprang in fury, helmed in fiery bronze he plowed through the front and charging the enemy, glaring left and right he hurled his spear-a glinting brazen streak- and the Trojans gave ground, scattering back, panicking there before his whirling shaft- a direct hit! Odysseus struck Democoon, Priam's bastard son come down from Abydos, Priam's racing-stables. Incensed for the dead Odysseus speared him straight through one temple and out the other punched the sharp bronze point and the dark came swirling thick across his eyes- down he crashed, armor clanging against his chest. And the Trojan front shrank back, glorious Hector too as the Argives yelled and dragged away the corpses, pushing on, breakneck on. But lord god Apollo, gazing down now from the heights of Pergamus, rose in outrage, crying down at the Trojans, "Up and at them, you stallion-breaking Trojans! Never give up your lust for war against these Argives! What are their bodies made of, rock or iron to block your tearing bronze? Stab them, slash their fleshl Achilles the son of lovely sleek-haired Thetis— the man's not even fighting, no, he wallows in all his heartsick fury by the ships!" So he cried from far on the city's heights, the awesome god Apollo. But Zeus's daughter Athena spurred the Argives on- Athena first in glory, third-born of the gods- whenever she saw some slacker hanging back as she hurtled through the onset. Now Amarinceus' son Diores—fate shackled Diores fast and a jagged rock struck him against his right shin, beside the-ankle. Pirous son of Imbrasus winged it hard and true, the Thracian chief who had sailed across from Aenus ... the ruthless rock striking the bones and tendons crushed them to pulp-he landed flat on his back, slamming the dust, both arms flung out to his comrades, gasping out his life. Pirous who heaved the rock came rushing in and speared him up the navel— his bowels uncoiled, spilling loose on the ground and the dark came swirling down across his eyes. But Pirous— Aetolian Thoas speared him as he swerved and sprang away, the lancehead piercing his chest above the nipple plunged deep in his lung, and Thoas, running up, wrenched the heavy spear from the man's chest, drew his blade, ripped him across the belly, took his life but he could not strip his armor. Look, there were Pirous' cohorts bunched in a ring, Thracians, topknots waving, clutching their long pikes and rugged, strong and proud as the Trojan Thoas was, they shoved him back-he gave ground, staggering, reeling. And so the two lay stretched in the dust, side-by-side, a lord of Thrace, a lord of Epeans armed in bronze and a ruck of other soldiers died around them. And now no man who waded into that work could scorn it any longer, anyone still not speared or stabbed by tearing bronze who whirled into the heart of all that slaughter— not even if great Athena led him by the hand, flicking away the weapons hailing down against him. That day ranks of Trojans, ranks of Achaean fighters sprawled there side-by-side, facedown in the dust. Then Pallas Athena granted Tydeus' son Diomedes strength and daring—so the fighter would shine forth and tower over the Argives and win himself great glory. She set the man ablaze, his shield and helmet flaming with tireless fire like the star that flames at harvest, bathed in the Ocean, rising up to outshine all other stars. Such fire Athena blazed from Tydides' head and shoulders, drove him into the center where the masses struggled on. There was a Trojan, Dares, a decent, wealthy man, the god Hephaestus' priest who had bred two sons, Phegeus and Idaeus, trained for every foray ... Breaking ranks they rushed ahead in their chariot, charging Diomedes already dismounted, rearing up on foot. They went for each other fast, close range- Phegeus hurled first, his spear's shadow flew and over Tydides' left shoulder the tip passed and never touched his body. Tydides hurled next, the bronze launched from his hand and not for nothing: hitting Phegeus' chest between the nipples it pitched him out behind his team. Idaeus leapt, abandoned the handsome car but did not dare to stand and defend his dead brother- and not even so would he have fled his black death but the god of fire swept him off and saved him, shrouding the man in night so the old priest would not be wholly crushed with one son left. But high-hearted Tydides drove away the team and gave them to aides to lash both horses back to the hollow ships. And now despite their courage the Trojan fighters seeing the two sons of Dares, one on the run, one dead beside his chariot- all their hearts were stunned . . . But Athena, eyes bright, taking Ares in hand, called the violent god away with: "Ares, Ares, destroyer of men, reeking blood, stormer of ramparts, why not let these mortals fight it out for themselves? Let Zeus give glory to either side he chooses. We'll stay clear and escape the Father's rage." And so, luring the headlong Ares off the lines Athena sat him down on Scamander's soft, sandy banks while Argives bent the Trojans back. Each captain killed his man. First Agamemnon lord of men spilled the giant Odius, chief of the Halizonians off his car—the first to fall, as he veered away the spearhead punched his back between the shoulders, gouging his flesh and jutting out through his ribs- he fell with a crash, his armor rang against him. Idomeneus cut down Phaestus, Maeonian Borus' son who shipped to Troy from the good rich earth of Tame. As he tried to mount behind his team the famous spearman stabbed a heavy javelin deep in his right shoulder— he dropped from his war-car, gripped by the hateful dark. Then as Idomeneus' henchman stripped the corpse Menelaus took Scamandrius down with a sharp spear— Strophius' son, a crack marksman skilled at the hunt. Artemis taught the man herself to track and kill wild beasts, whatever breeds in the mountain woods, but the Huntress showering arrows could not save him now nor the archer's long shots, his forte in days gone by. No, now Menelaus the great spearman ran him through, square between the blades as he fled and raced ahead, tearing into his flesh, drilling out through his chest he crashed facedown, his armor clanged against him. Meriones killed Phereclus—son of Tecton, son of the blacksmith Harmon-the fighter's hands had the skill to craft all kinds of complex work since Pallas Athena loved him most, her protege who had built Paris his steady, balanced ships, trim launchers of death, freighted with death for all of Troy and now for the shipwright too: what could the man know of all the gods' decrees? Meriones caught him quickly, running him down hard and speared him low in the right buttock—the point pounding under the pelvis, jabbed and pierced the bladder- he dropped to his knees, screaming, death swirling round him. Meges killed Pedaeus, Antenor's son, a bastard boy but lovely Theano nursed him with close, loving care like her own children, just to please her husband. Closing, Meges gave him some close attention too— the famous spearman struck behind his skull, just at the neck-cord, the razor spear slicing straight up through the jaws, cutting away the tongue— he sank in the dust, teeth clenching the cold bronze. Euaemon's son Eurypylus cut down brave Hypsenor, son of lofty Dolopion, a man the Trojans made Scamander's priest and worshipped like a god. But Euaemon's royal son laid low his son- Eurypylus, chasing Hypsenor fleeing on before him, flailed with a sword, slashed the Trojan's shoulder and lopped away the massive bulk of Hypsenor's arm . . . the bloody arm dropped to the earth, and red death came plunging down his eyes, and the strong force of fate. So they worked away in the rough assaults, but Diomedes, which side was the fighter on? You could not tell- did he rampage now with the Trojans or the Argives? Down the plain he stormed like a stream in spate, a routing winter torrent sweeping away the dikes: the tight, piled dikes can't hold it back any longer, banks shoring the blooming vineyards cannot curb its course— a flash flood bursts as the rains from Zeus pour down their power, acre on acre the well-dug work of farmers crumbling under it- so under Tydides' force the Trojan columns panicked now, no standing their ground, massed, packed as they were. But the shining archer Pandarus marked him storming down the plain, smashing the Trojan lines before him. Quickly he trained his reflex bow on Diomedes charging straight ahead-he shot! he struck him full in the right shoulder, under the breastplate's hollow the ripping point tore deep, shearing its way through, armor splattered with blood as Pandarus triumphed, shouting over Tydides wildly, "Move up, attack, my high-hearted Trojans, lash your stallions! Look, the Achaean champion's badly wounded— I shot him down, I swear he won't last long— if the Archer really sped me here from Lycia!" Bragging so, but the whizzing arrow had not brought him down. Diomedes just drew back beside his car and team and stood there calling Sthenelus, Capaneus' son: "Quick, Sthenelus. Down from the car, my friend, pull this wretched arrow from my shoulder!" Sthenelus sprang from the car, hit the ground and standing beside him, pulled the tearing arrow clean on through the wound and blood came shooting out like a red lance through the supple mesh shirt. And Diomedes lord of the war cry prayed aloud, "Hear me, daughter of Zeus whose shield is thunder, tireless one, Athena! If you ever stood by father with all your love amidst the blaze of battle, stand by me--do me a favor now, Athena. Bring that man into range and let me spear him! He's wounded me off guard and now he triumphs- he boasts 1 won't look long on the light of day." So Tydides prayed and Athena heard his prayer, put spring in his limbs, his feet, his fighting hands and close beside him winged him on with a flight of orders: "Now take heart, Diomedes, fight it out with the Trojans! Deep in your chest I've put your father's strength. He never quaked, that Tydeus, that great horseman- what force the famous shieldsman used to wield! Look, I've lifted the mist from off your eyes that's blurred them up to now— so you can tell a god from man on sight. So now if a god comes up to test your mettle, you must not fight the immortal powers head-on, all but one of the deathless gods, that is- if Aphrodite daughter of Zeus slips into battle, she's the one to stab with your sharp bronze spear!" Her eyes bright, Athena soared away and Tydeus' son went charging back to the front line of champions. Now, long ablaze as he was to fight the Trojans, triple the fury seized him-claw-mad as a lion some shepherd tending woolly flocks in the field has just grazed, a lion leaping into the fold, but he hasn't killed him, only spurred his strength and helpless to beat him off the man scurries for shelter, leaving his flocks panicked, lost as the ramping beast mauls them thick-and-fast, piling corpse on corpse and in one furious bound clears the fenced yard— so raging Diomedes mauled the Trojans. There— he killed Astynous, then Hypiron, a frontline captain. One he stabbed with a bronze lance above the nipple, the other his heavy sword hacked at the collarbone, right on the shoulder, cleaving the whole shoulder clear of neck and back. And he left them there, dead, and he made a rush at Abas and Polyidus, sons of Eurydamas, an aged reader of dreams, but the old prophet read no dreams for them when they set out for Troy-Diomedes laid them low then swung to attack the two sons of Phaenops, hardy Xanthus and Thoon, both men grown tall as their father shrank away with wasting age ... he'd never breed more sons to leave his riches to. The son of Tydeus killed the two of them on the spot, he ripped the dear life out of both and left their father tears and wrenching grief. Now he'd never welcome his two sons home from war, alive in the flesh, and distant kin would carve apart their birthright. Next Diomedes killed two sons of Dardan Priam careening on in a single car, Echemmon and Chromius. As a lion charges cattle, calves and heifers browsing the deep glades and snaps their necks, so Tydides pitched them both from the chariot, gave them a mauling-gave them little choice— quickly stripped their gear and passed their team to his men to lash back to the ships. Smashing the lines of fighters now— but Aeneas marked it all and oblivious to the rain of spears he waded in, hunting for Pandarus, hoping to find the archer. Find him he did, Lycaon's skilled, fearless son, and went right up and challenged him to his face: "Pandarus, where's your bow, your winged arrows, your archer's glory? No Trojan your rival here, no Lycian can claim to be your better, no— so up with you now! Lift your hands to Zeus, you whip an arrow against that man, whoever he is who routs us, wreaking havoc against us, cutting the legs from under squads of good brave men. Unless it's a god who smolders at our troops, enraged at a rite we failed- when a god's enraged there's thunder at our heads.". And Lycaon's shining son took up the challenge: "Aeneas, counselor of the Trojans armed in bronze, he looks like Tydeus' son to me in every way- I know his shield, the hollow eyes of his visor, his team, I've watched them closely. And still I could never swear he's not a god ... but if he's the man I think he is, Tydeus' gallant son, he rages so with a god beside him-not alone, no- a god with his shoulders shrouded round in cloud who deflects my shaft to a less mortal spot. I had already whipped an arrow into him, caught him square in the right shoulder too, just where the breastplate leaves the armpit bare, and I thought I'd sent him down to the House of Death but I've still not laid him low. So it is some god rampaging! And here I am, no chariot, no team to speed me on. But back in Lycaon's halls are eleven war-cars, beauties all, fresh from the smith and fire-new and blankets spread across them. And beside each a brace of stallions standing poised and pawing, champing their oats and barley glistening white. Over and over father, the old spearman Lycaon urged me, setting out from his well-built halls, 'Take those teams and cars,' he told me, 'mount up, lead the Trojans into the jolting shocks of battle!' But would I listen? So much the better if I had ... I had to spare my teams. They'd never starve for fodder- crammed with the fighters-bred to eat their fill. So I left them there, I made it to Troy on foot, trusting my bows and arrows, and a lot of good I was to get from them. Already I've let fly at two of their best men, Diomedes and Menelaus- I've hit them both, and the blood gushed from both, direct hits, but I only roused their fury. What bad luck— to snatch this curved bow off its peg that day I marched my Trojans hard to your lovely town of Troy, to please Prince Hector. But if I get home again and set my eyes on my native land, my wife and my fine house with the high vaulting roof, let some stranger cut my head off then and there if I don't smash this bow and fling it in the fire- the gear I packed is worthless as the wind." Aeneas the Trojan captain checked him sharply: "No talk of turning for home! No turning the tide till we wheel and face this man with team and car and fight it out with weapons hand-to-hand. Come, up with you now, climb aboard my chariot! So you can see the breed of Tros's team, their flair for their own terrain as they gallop back and forth, one moment in flight, the next in hot pursuit. They'll sweep us back to the city, back to safety if Zeus hands Tydeus' son the glory once again. Quick, take up the whip and glittering reins! I'll dismount from the car and fight on foot- or you engage the man and leave the team to me." The shining son of Lycaon made the choice: "Take upy the reins yourself, Aeneas. Do- they're your team, they'll haul your curving chariot so much better under the driver they know best if we have to beat retreat from Diomedes. God forbid they panic, skittish with fear, buck and never pull us out of the fighting, missing your own voice as Tydeus' son attacks- he'll kill us both and drive them off as prizes. So drive them yourself, your chariot and your team and let him charge—I'll take him on with a sharp spear." Both men agreed, boarding the blazoned chariot, wildly heading their racers at Diomedes now. Capaneus' good son Sthenelus saw them coming and quickly alerted Diomedes, warnings flying: "Tydides, joy of my heart, dear comrade, look! I see two men and they're bearing down to fight you! Their power's enormous—one's a master archer, Pandarus, son of Lycaon, so he boasts. The other's Aeneas, claims Anchises' blood, the noble Anchises, but his mother's Aphrodite. Come, up you go in our chariot, give ground now! No charging the front ranks—you might lose your life." But powerful Diomedes -froze him with a glance: "Not a word of retreat. You'll never persuade me. It's not my nature to shrink from battle, cringe in fear with the fighting strength still steady in my chest. I shrink from mounting our chariot-no retreat- on foot as I am, I'll meet them man-to-man. Athena would never let me flinch. Those two? Their horses will never sweep them clear of us, not both men, though one or the other may escape. One more thing—take it to heart, I tell you— if part of Athena's plan gives me the honor to kill them both, you check our racers here, you lash them fast to our rails then dash for Aeneas' horses—don't forget— drive them out of the Trojan lines and into ours. They are the very strain farseeing Zeus gave Tros, payment in full for stealing Ganymede, Tros's son: the purest, strongest breed of all the stallions under the dawn and light of day. Lord Anchises stole from that fine stock-behind Laomedon's back, Tros's grandson and heir to Tros's teams— he put some mares to the lusty stallions once and they foaled him a run of six in his'royal house. Four he kept for himself, to rear in his own stalls, but the two you see in action he gave Aeneas, both of them driving terrors. Would to god we'd take them both—we'd win ourselves great fame." Wavering back and forth as their two attackers closed in a rush, whipping that purebred team along and Pandarus shouted first, "What mad bravado- lofty Tydeus' boy will brave it out! So, my arrow failed to bring you down, my tearing shot? Now for a spear—we'll see if this can kill you!" Shaft poised, he hurled and its long shadow flew and it struck Tydides' shield, the brazen spearhead winging, drilling right on through to his breastplate, Pandarus yelling over him wildly now, "You're hit clean through the side! You won't last long, I'd say- now the glory's mine!" But never shaken, staunch Diomedes shot back, "No hit you missed! But the two of you will never quit this fight, I'd say, till one of you drops and dies and gluts with blood Ares who hacks at men behind his rawhide shield!" With that he hurled and Athena drove the shaft and it split the archer's nose between the eyes— it cracked his glistening teeth, the tough bronze cut off his tongue at the roots, smashed his jaw and the point came ripping out beneath his chin. He pitched from his car, armor clanged against him, a glimmering blaze of metal dazzling round his back— the purebreds reared aside, hoofs pawing the air and his life and power slipped away on the wind. Aeneas sprang down with his shield and heavy spear, fearing the Argives might just drag away the corpse, somehow, somewhere. Aeneas straddled the body- proud in his fighting power like some lion- shielded the corpse with spear and round buckler, burning to kill off any man who met him face-to-face and he loosed a bloodcurdling cry. Just as Diomedes hefted a boulder in his hands, a tremendous feat— no two men could hoist it, weak as men are now, but all on his own he raised it high with ease, flung it and struck Aeneas' thigh where the hipbone turns inside the pelvis, the joint they call the cup- it smashed the socket, snapped both tendons too and the jagged rock tore back the skin in shreds. The great fighter sank to his knees, bracing himself with one strong forearm planted against the earth, and the world went black as night before his eyes. And now the prince, the captain of men Aeneas would have died on the spot if Zeus's daughter had not marked him quickly, his mother Aphrodite who bore him to King Anchises tending cattle once. Round her beloved son her glistening arms went streaming, flinging her shining robe before him, only a fold but it blocked the weapons hurtling toward his body. She feared some Argive fast with chariot-team might hurl bronze in his chest and rip his life out. She began to bear her dear son from the fighting . . . but Capaneus' son did not forget the commands the lord of the war cry put him under. Sthenelus checked his own racers clear of the crash of battle, lashed them tight to his chariot-rails with reins then dashed for Aeneas' glossy full-maned team and drove them out of the Trojan lines and into his. He passed them on to Deipylus, a friend-in-arms he prized beyond all comrades his own age- their minds worked as one-to drive to the ships as Sthenelus mounted behind his own chariot now, seized the glittering reins and whipped his team, his strong-hoofed horses ahead at breakneck speed, rearing, plunging to overtake his captain Diomedes but he with his ruthless bronze was hunting Aphrodite- Diomedes, knowing her for the coward goddess she is, none of the mighty gods who marshal men to battle, neither Athena nor Enyo raider of cities, not at all, But once he caught her, stalking her through the onslaught, gallant Tydeus' offspring rushed her, lunging out, thrusting his sharp spear at her soft, limp wrist and the brazen point went slashing through her flesh, tearing straight 'through the fresh immortal robes the Graces themselves had made her with their labor. He gouged her just where the wristbone joins the palm and immortal blood came flowing quickly from the goddess, the ichor that courses through their veins, the blessed gods- they eat no bread, they drink no shining wine, and so the gods are bloodless, so we call them deathless. A piercing shriek-she reeled and dropped her son. But Phoebus Apollo plucked him up in his hands and swathed him round in a swirling dark mist for fear some Argive fast with chariot-team might hurl bronze in his chest and rip his life out. But Diomedes shouted after her, shattering war cries: "Daughter of Zeus, give up the war, your lust for carnage! So, it's not enough that you lure defenseless women to their ruin? Haunting the fighting, are you? Now I think you'll cringe at the hint of war if you get wind of battle far away." So he mocked and the goddess fled the front, beside herself with pain. But Iris quick as the wind took up her hand and led her from the fighting ... racked with agony, her glowing flesh blood-dark. And off to the left of battle she discovered Ares, violent Ares sitting there at ease, his long spear braced on a cloudbank, flanked by racing stallions. Aphrodite fell to her knees, over and over begged her dear brother to lend his golden-bridled team: "Oh dear brother, help me! Give me your horses- so I can reach Olympus, the gods' steep stronghold. I'm wounded, the pain's too much, a mortal's speared me— that daredevil Diomedes, he'd fight Father Zeusl" Her brother Ares gave her the golden-bridled team. Heart writhing in pain, she climbed aboard the car and Iris climbed beside her, seized the reins, whipped the team to a run and on the horses flew, holding nothing back. In a moment they had reached the immortals' stronghold, steep Olympus. Wind-quick Iris curbed the team and loosing them from the chariot threw ambrosial fodder down before their hoofs. The deathless Aphrodite sank in Dione's lap and her mother, folding her daughter in her arms, stroked her gently, whispered her name and asked, "Who has abused you now, dear child, tell me, who of the sons of heaven so unfeeling, cruel? Why, it's as if they had caught you in public, doing something wrong. . . " And Aphrodite who loves eternal laughter sobbed in answer, "The son of Tydeus stabbed me, Diomedes, that overweening, insolent—all because I was bearing off my son from the fighting. Aeneas— dearest to me of all the men alive. Look down! It's no longer ghastly war for Troy and Achaea- now, I tell you, the Argives fight the gods!" Dione the light and loveliest of immortals tried to calm her: "Patience, oh my child. Bear up now, despite your heartsick grief. How many gods who hold the halls of Olympus have had to endure such wounds from mortal men, whenever we try to cause each other pain ... Ares had to endure it, when giant Ephialtes and Otus, sons of Aloeus, bound him in chains he could not burst, trussed him up in a brazen cauldron, thirteen months. And despite the god's undying lust for battle Ares might have wasted away there on the spot if the monsters' stepmother, beautiful Eriboea had not sent for Hermes, and out of the cauldron Hermes stole him away-the War-god breathing his last, all but broken down by the ruthless iron chains. And Hera endured it too, that time Amphitryon's son, mighty Heracles hit her deep in the right breast with a three-barbed shaft, and pain seized her, nothing calmed the pain. Even tremendous Hades had to endure that flying shaft like all the rest, when the same man, the son of thunder-shielded Zeus, shot him in Pylos—there with the troops of battle dead— and surrendered Death to pain. But Hades made his way to craggy Olympus, climbed to the house of Zeus, stabbed with agony, grief-struck to the heart, the shaft driven into his massive shoulder grinding down his spirit . . . But the Healer applied his pain-killing drugs and sealed Hades' wound—he was not born to die. Think of that breakneck Heracles, his violent work, not a care in the world for all the wrongs he'd done- he and his arrows raking the gods who hold Olympus! But the man who attacked you? The great goddess fiery-eyed Athena set him on, that fool- Doesn't the son of Tydeus know, down deep, the man who fights the gods does not live long? Nor do his children ride his knees with cries of 'Father'— home at last from the wars and heat of battle. So now let Diomedes, powerful as he is, be on his guard for fear a better soldier than you engage him- for fear his wife, Aegialia, Adrastus' daughter, for all her self-control, will wail through the nights and wake her beloved servants out of sleep . . . the gallant wife in tears, longing for him, her wedded husband, the best of the Achaeans— Diomedes breaker of horses." Soothing words, and with both her hands Dione gently wiped the ichor from Aphrodite's arm and her wrist healed at once, her stark pain ebbed away. But Hera and great Athena were looking on and with mocking words began to provoke the Father, Athena leading off with taunts, her eyes bright: "Father Zeus, I wonder if you would fume at me if I ventured a bold guess? Our goddess of love— I'd swear she's just been rousing another Argive, another beauty to pant and lust for Trojans, those men the goddess loves to such despair. Stroking one of the Argive women's rippling gowns she's pricked her limp wrist on a golden pinpoint!" So she mocked, and the father of gods and mortals smiled broadly, calling the golden Aphrodite over: "Fighting is not for you, my child, the works of war. See to the works of marriage, the slow fires of longing. Athena and blazing Ares will deal with all the bloodshed." And now as the high gods bantered back and forth Diomedes, loosing his war cry, charged Aeneas- though what he saw was lord Apollo himself, guarding, spreading his arms above the fighter, but even before the mighty god he would not flinch. Tydides reared and hurled himself again and again, trying to kill Aeneas, strip his famous armor. Three times he charged, frenzied to bring him down, three times Apollo battered his gleaming shield back- then at Tydides' fourth assault like something superhuman, the Archer who strikes from worlds away shrieked out - a voice of terror—"Think, Diomedes, shrink back now! Enough of this madness-striving with the gods. We are not of the same breed, we never will be, the deathless gods and men who walk the earth." Menacing so that Tydeus' son pulled back, just a little, edging clear of the distant deadly Archer's rage. And Apollo swept Aeneas up from the onslaught and set him down on the sacred heights of Pergamus, the crest where the god's own temple had been built. There in the depths of the dark forbidden chamber Leto and Artemis who showers flights of arrows healed the man and brought him back to glory. But the lord of the silver bow devised a phantom- like Aeneas to the life, wearing his very armor- and round that phantom Trojans and brave Achaeans went at each other, hacking the oxhides round their chests, the bucklers full and round, skin-shields, tassels flying. But Phoebus Apollo called to blazing Ares, "Ares, Ares, destroyer of men, reeking blood, stormer of ramparts, can't you go and drag that man from the fighting? That daredevil Diomedes, he'd fight Father Zeus! He's just assaulted Love, he stabbed her wrist like something superhuman he even charged at me!" With that,. Apollo settled onto Pergamus heights while murderous Ares, wading into the fighting, spurred the Trojan columns on to mass attack. Shaped like the runner Acamas, prince of Thrace, Ares challenged the sons of Priam with a vengeance: "You royal sons of Priam, monarch dear to the gods, how long will you let Achaeans massacre your army? Until they're battling round your well-built gates? A man is down we prized on a par with noble Hector— Aeneas, proud Anchises' son., Up with you now, rescue him from the crash of battle! Save our comrade!" As Ares whipped the fighting spirit in each man Sarpedon taunted Hector: "Hector, where has it gone- that high courage you always carried in your heart? No doubt you bragged that you could hold your city without an army and Trojan allies—all on your own, just with your sister's husbands and your brothers. But where are they now? I look, I can't find one. They cringe and cower like hounds circling a lion. We-your allies here-we do your fighting for you. And I myself, Hector, your ally-to-the-death, a good long way I came from distant Lycia, far from the Xanthus' rapids where I left my loving wife, my baby son, great riches too, the lasting envy of every needy neighbor. And still I lead our Lycians into battle. Myself? I chafe to face my man, full force, though there's not a scrap of mine for looting here, no cattle or gold the foe could carry off. But you, you just stand there-don't even command the rest to brace and defend their wives. Beware the toils of war . . . the mesh of the huge dragnet sweeping up the world, before you're trapped, your enemies' prey and plunder— soon they'll raze your sturdy citadel to the roots! All this should obsess you, Hector, night and day. You should be begging the men who lead your allies' famous ranks to stand and fight for all they're worth— you'll ward off all the blame they hurl against you." And Sarpedon's charge cut Hector to the core. Down he leapt from his chariot fully armed, hit the ground and brandishing two sharp spears went striding down his lines, ranging flank to flank, driving his fighters into battle, rousing grisly war—and round the Trojans whirled, bracing to meet the Argives face-to-face: but the Argives closed ranks, did not cave in. Remember the wind that scatters the dry chaff, sweeping it over the sacred threshing floor, the men winnowing hard and blond Demeter culling grain from dry husk in the rough and gusting wind and under it all the heaps of chaff are piling white . . . so white the Achaeans turned beneath the dust storm now, pelting across their faces, kicked up by horses' hoofs to the clear bronze sky-the battle joined again. Charioteers swung chariots round, thrust the powerful fist of fury straight ahead and murderous Ares keen to help the Trojans shrouded the carnage over in dense dark night- lunging at all points, carrying out the commands of Phoebus Apollo, lord of the golden sword, who ordered Ares to whip the Trojans' war-lust once he spotted Athena veering off the lines, great Pallas who'd rushed to back the Argives. Out of his rich guarded chamber the god himself launched Aeneas now, driving courage into his heart and the captain took his place amidst his men. And how they thrilled to see him still alive, safe, unharmed and marching back to their lines, his soul ablaze for war, but his men asked him nothing. The labor of battle would not let them, more labor urged by the god of the silver bow and man-destroying Ares and Strife flaring on, headlong on. The Achaeans? The two Aeantes, Tydides and Odysseus spurred them on to attack. The troops themselves had no fear, no dread of the Trojans' power and breakneck charges, no, they stood their ground like heavy thunderheads stacked up on the towering mountaintops by Cronus' son, stock-still in a windless calm when the raging North Wind and his gusty ripping friends that had screamed down to rout dark clouds have fallen dead asleep. So staunch they stood the Trojan onslaught, never shrinking once as Atrides ranged the ranks, shouting out commands: "Now be men, my friends! Courage, come, take heart! Dread what comrades say of you here in bloody combat! When men dread that, more men come through alive— when soldiers break and run, good-bye glory, good-bye all defenses!" A f'ash, a sudden hurl and Atrides speared a champion out in front— it was Prince Aeneas' comrade-in-arms Deicoon, Pergasus' son the Trojans prized like Priam's sons, quick as he always was to join the forward ranks. Now his shield took powerful Agamemnon's spear but failed to deflect it, straight through it smashed, bronze splitting his belt and plunging down his guts— he fell, thundering, armor ringing against him. There— Aeneas replied in kind and killed two Argive captains, Diocles' two sons, Orsilochus flanking Crethon. Their father lived in the fortress town of Phera, a man of wealth and worth, born of Alpheus River running wide through Pylian hills, the stream that sired Ortilochus to rule their many men. Ortilochus sired Diocles, that proud heart, and Diocles bred Orsilochus twinned with Crethon drilled for any fight. And reaching their prime they joined the Argives sailing the black ships outward bound for the stallion-land of Troy, all for the sons of Atreus, to fight to the end and win their honor back- so death put an end to both, wrapped them both in night. Fresh as two young lions off on the mountain ridges, twins reared by a lioness deep in the dark glades, that ravage shepherds' steadings, mauling the cattle and fat sheep till it's their turn to die-hacked down by the cleaving bronze blades in the shepherds' hands. So here the twins were laid low at Aeneas' hands, down they crashed like lofty pine trees axed. Both down but Menelaus pitied them both, yes, and out for blood he burst through the front, helmed in fiery bronze, shaking his spear, and Ares' fury drove him, Ares hoping to see him crushed at Aeneas' hands. Antilochus marked him now, great Nestor's son went racing across the front himself, terrified for the lord of armies—what if he were killed? Their hard campaigning just might come to grief. As Aeneas and Menelaus came within arm's reach, waving whetted spears in each other's faces, nerved to fight it out, Antilochus rushed in, tensing shoulder-to-shoulder by his captain now- and Aeneas shrank from battle, fast as he was in arms, when he saw that pair of fighters side-by-side, standing their ground against him . . . Once they'd dragged the bodies back to their lines they dropped the luckless twins in companions' open arms and round they swung again to fight in the first ranks. And next they killed Pylaemenes tough as Ares, a captain heading the Paphlagonian shieldsmen, hot-blooded men. Menelaus the famous spearman stabbed him right where he stood, the spearpoint pounding his collarbone to splinters. Antilochus killed his charioteer and steady henchman Mydon, Atymnius' strapping son, just wheeling his racers round as Antilochus winged a rock and smashed his elbow- out of his grip the reins white with ivory flew and slipped to the ground and tangled in the dust. Antilochus sprang, he plunged a sword in his temple and Mydon, gasping, hurled from his bolted car facefirst, head and shoulders stuck in a dune a good long time for the sand was soft and deep—his lucky day— till his own horses trampled him down, down flat as Antilochus lashed them hard and drove them back to Achaea's waiting ranks. But Hector marked them across the lines and rushed them now with a cry and Trojan shock troops backed him full strength. And Ares led them in with the deadly Queen Enyo bringing Uproar on, the savage chaos of battle— the god of combat wielding his giant shaft in hand, now ranging ahead of Hector, now behind him. Ares there— and for all his war cries Diomedes shrank at the sight, as a man at a loss, helpless, crossing a vast plain halts short at a river rapids surging out to sea, takes one look at the water roaring up in foam and springs back with a leap. So he recoiled, shouting out to comrades, "Oh my friends, what fools we were to marvel at wondrous Hector, what a spearman, we said, and what a daring fighter! But a god goes with him always, beating off disaster— look, that's Ares beside him now, just like a mortal! Give ground, but faces fronting the Trojans always— no use trying to fight the gods in force." So he warned as the Trojans charged them, harder-and Hector, lunging, leveled a pair of men who knew the joy of battle, riding a single chariot, Menesthes and Anchialus. Down they went and the Great Ajax pitied both, he strode to their side and loomed there, loosed a gleaming spear and struck down Amphius, Selagus' son who had lived at ease in Paesus, rich in possessions, rich in rolling wheatland ... But destiny guided Amphius on, a comrade sworn to the cause of Priam and all of Priam's sons. Now giant Ajax speared him through the belt, deep in the guts the long, shadowy shaft stuck and down he fell with a crash as glorious Ajax rushed to strip his armor—Trojans showering spears against him, points glittering round him, his shield taking repeated hits. He dug his heel in the corpse, yanked his own bronze out but as for the dead man's burnished gear-no hope. The giant was helpless to rip it off his back. Enemy weapons beating against him, worse, he dreaded the Trojans too, swarming round him, a tough ring of them, brave and bristling spears, massing, rearing over their comrade's body now and rugged, strong and proud as the Great Ajax was, they shoved him back—he gave ground, staggering, reeling. So fighters worked away in the grim shocks of war. And Heracles' own son, Tlepolemus tall and staunch . . . his strong fate was driving him now against Sarpedon, a man like a god. Closing quickly, coming head-to-head the son and the son's son of Zeus who marshals storms, Tlepolemus opened up to taunt his enemy first: "Sarpedon, master strategist of the Lycians, what compels you to cringe and cower here? You raw recruit, green at the skills of battle! They lie when they say you're born of storming Zeus. Look at yourself. How short you fall of the fighters sired by Zeus in the generations long before us! Why, think what they say of mighty Heracles- there was a man, my father, that dauntless, furious spirit, that lionheart. He once sailed here for Laomedon's blooded horses, with just six ships and smaller crews than yours, true, but he razed the walls of Troy, he widowed all her streets. You with your coward's heart, your men dying round you! You're no bulwark come out of Lycia, I can tell you— no help to Trojans here. For all your power, soldier, crushed at my hands you'll breach the gates of Death!" But Sarpedon the Lycian captain faced him down: "Right you are, Tlepolemus! Your great father destroyed the sacred heights of Troy, thanks, of course, to a man's stupidity, proud Laomedon. That fool—he rewarded all his kindness with abuse, never gave him the mares he'd come so far to win. But the only thing you'll win at my hands here, I promise you, is slaughter and black doom. Gouged by my spear you'll give me glory now, you'll give your life to the famous horseman Death!" In fast reply Tlepolemus raised his ashen spear and the same moment shafts flew from their hands and Sarpedon hit him square across the neck, the spear went ramming through-pure agony- black night came swirling down across his eyes. But Tlepolemus' shaft had struck Sarpedon too, the honed tip of the weapon hitting his left thigh, ferocious, razoring into flesh and scraping bone but his Father beat off death a little longer. Heroic Sarpedon— his loyal comrades bore him out of the fighting quickly, weighed down by the heavy spearshaft dragging on. But hurrying so, no one noticed or even thought to wrench the ashen javelin from his thigh so the man could hobble upright. On they rushed, bent on the work of tending to his body. Tlepolemus— far across the lines the armed Achaeans hauled him out of the fight, and seasoned Odysseus saw it, his brave spirit steady, ablaze for action now. What should he do?-he racked his heart and soul- lunge at Prince Sarpedon, son of storming Zeus, or go at the Lycians' mass and kill them all? But no, it was not the gallant Odysseus' fate to finish Zeus's rugged son with his sharp bronze, so Pallas swung his fury against the Lycian front. Whirling, killing Coeranus, Chromius and Alastor, killing Alcander and Halius, Prytanis and Noemon- and stalwart Odysseus would have killed still more but tall Hector, his helmet flashing, marked him quickly, plowed through the front, helmed in fiery bronze, filling the Argives' hearts with sudden terror. And Zeus's son Sarpedon rejoiced to see him striding past and begged him in his pain, "Son of Priam, don't leave me lying here, such easy prey for the Danaans-protect me! Later I'll bleed to death inside your walls. Clearly it's not my fate to journey home again to the fatherland I love, to bring some joy to my dear wife, my baby son." But Hector, his helmet flashing, answered nothing-he swept past him, Hector burning to thrust the Argives back at once and tear the life and soul out of whole battalions. But Sarpedon's loyal comrades laid him down, a man like a god beneath a fine spreading oak sacred to Zeus whose shield is banked with clouds. The veteran Pelagon, one of his closest aides, pushed the shaft of ashwood out through his wound— his spirit left him-a mist poured down his eyes . . . but he caught his breath again. A gust of the North Wind blowing round him carried back the life breath he had gasped away in pain. But the Argive fighters? Facing Ares' power and Hector helmed in bronze, they neither turned and ran for their black ships nor traded blows with enemies man-to-man. Backing over and over, the Argives gave ground, seeing the lord of battles lead the Trojan onset. Who was the first they slaughtered, who the last, the brazen god of war and Hector son of Priam? Teuthras first, Orestes lasher of stallions next, an Aetolian spearman Trechus, Oenomaus and Helenus, Oenops' son, and Oresbius cinched with shining belt who had lived in Hyle hoarding his great wealth, his estate aslope the shores of Lake Cephisus, and round him Boeotians held the fertile plain. But soon as the white-armed goddess Hera saw them mauling Argive units caught in the bloody press, she winged her words at Pallas: "What disaster! Daughter of storming Zeus, tireless one, Athena- how hollow our vow to Menelaus that he would sack the mighty walls of Troy before he sailed for home- if we let murderous Ares rampage on this way. Up now, set our minds on our own fighting-fury!" Hera's challenge— and goddess Athena, her eyes afire, could not resist. Hera queen of the gods, daughter of giant Cronus, launched the work, harnessed the golden-bridled team and Hebe quickly rolled the wheels to the chariot, paired wheels with their eight spokes all bronze, and bolted them on at both ends of the iron axle. Fine wheels with fellies of solid, deathless gold and round them running rims of bronze clamped fast— a marvel to behold! The silver hubs spin round on either side of the chariot's woven body, gold and silver lashings strapping it tight, double rails sweeping along its deep full curves and the yoke-pole jutting forward, gleaming silver. There at the tip she bound the gorgeous golden yoke, she fastened the gorgeous golden breast straps next and under the yoke Queen Hera led the horses, racers blazing for war and the piercing shrieks of battle. Then Athena, child of Zeus whose shield is thunder, letting fall her supple robe at the Father's threshold— rich brocade, stitched with her own hands' labor— donned the battle-shirt of the lord of lightning, buckled her breastplate geared for wrenching war and over her shoulders slung her shield, all tassels flaring terror-Panic mounted high in a crown around it, Hate and Defense across it, Assault to freeze the blood and right in their midst the Gorgon's monstrous head, that rippling dragon horror, sign of storming Zeus. Then over her brows Athena placed her golden helmet fronted with four knobs and forked with twin horns, engraved with the fighting men of a hundred towns. Then onto the flaming chariot Pallas set her feet and seized her spear-weighted, heavy, the massive shaft she wields to break the battle lines of heroes the mighty Father's daughter storms against. A crack of the whip— the goddess Hera lashed the team, and all on their own force the gates of heaven thundered open, kept by the Seasons, guards of the vaulting sky and Olympus heights empowered to spread the massing clouds or close them round once more. Now straight through the great gates she drove the team, whipping them on full tilt until they came to Zeus the son of Cronus sitting far from the other gods, throned on the topmost crag of rugged ridged Olympus. And halting her horses near, the white-armed Hera called out at once to the powerful son of Cronus, pressing home her questions: "Father Zeus, look— aren't you incensed at Ares and all his brutal work? Killing so many brave Achaeans for no good reason, not a shred of decency, just to wound my heart! While there they sit at their royal ease, exulting, the goddess of love and Apollo lord of the silver bow: they loosed this manic Ares—he has no sense of justice. Father Zeus . . . I wonder if you would fume at me if I hurled a stunning blow at the god of war and drove him from the fighting?" Zeus the Father who marshals ranks of storm clouds gave commands, "Leap to it then. Launch Athena against him- the queen of plunder, she's the one—his match, a marvel at bringing Ares down in pain." So he urged and the white-armed goddess Hera obeyed at once. And again she lashed her team and again the stallions flew, holding nothing back, careering between the earth and starry skies as far as a man's glance can pierce the horizon's misting haze, a scout on a watchtower who scans the wine-dark sea— so far do the soaring, thundering horses of the gods leap at a single stride. And once they reached the plains of Troy where the two rivers flow, where Simois and Scamander rush together, the white-armed goddess Hera reined her team, loosing them from the chariot-yoke and round them poured' a dense shrouding mist and before their hoofs the Simois sprang ambrosial grass for them to graze. The two immortals stepped briskly as wild doves, quivering, keen to defend the fighting men of Argos. Once they gained the spot where the most and bravest stood, flanking strong Diomedes breaker of wild stallions— massed like a pride of lions tearing raw flesh or ramping boars whose fury never flags— the white-armed goddess Hera rose and shouted loud as the brazen voice of great-lunged Stentor who cries out with the blast of fifty other men, "Shame! Disgrace! You Argives, you degraded- splendid in battle dress, pure sham! As long as brilliant Achilles stalked the front no Trojan would ever venture beyond the Dardan Gates, they were so afraid of the man's tremendous spear. Now they're fighting far away from the city, right by your hollow ships!" So Hera trumpeted, lashing the nerve and fighting-fury in each man as Athena, her eyes blazing, made for Diomedes. Hard by his team and car she found the king, cooling the wound that Pandarus' arrow dealt him. Sweat from under the heavy buckler's flat strap had rubbed him raw, he was chafed and his arm ached from lifting up the strap, wiping off the blood and the dark clots. Laying hold of the yoke that bound his team, the goddess Pallas started, "So, Tydeus' son is half the size of his father, and he was short and slight-but Tydeus was a fighter! Even then, when I forbade him to go to war or make a show of himself in others' eyes ... that time, alone, apart from his men, he marched the message into Thebes, filled with hordes of Thebans, I told him to banquet in their halls and eat in peace. But he always had that power, that courage from the first— and so he challenged the brave young blades of Thebes to tests of strength and beat them all with ease, I urged him on with so much winning force. But you, Tydides, I stand by you as well, I guard you too. And with all good will I say, fight it out with the Trojans here! But look at you- fatigue from too much charging has sapped your limbs, that or some lifeless fear has paralyzed you now. So you're no offspring of Tydeus, the gallant, battle-hardened Oeneus' son!" And powerful Diomedes bowed to her at once: "Well I know you, Goddess, daughter of storming Zeus, and so I will tell you all, gladly. I'll hide nothing. It's not some lifeless fear that paralyzes me now, no flinching from combat either. It's your own command still ringing in my ears, forbidding me to fight the immortals head-on, all but one of the blessed gods, that is— if Aphrodite daughter of Zeus slips into battle, she's the one to stab with my sharp bronze spear. So now, you see, I have given ground myself and told my comrades to mass around me here. Too well I know that Ares leads the charge." But the goddess roused him on, her eyes blazing: "True son of Tydeus, Diomedes, joy of my heart! Forget the orders-nothing to fear, my friend, neither Ares nor any other god. You too, I'll urge you on with so much winning force. Up now! Lash your racing horses at Ares first, strike him at close range, no shrinking away here before that headlong Ares! Just look at the maniac, born for disaster, double-dealing, lying two-faced god- just now he promised me and Hera, the War-god swore he'd fight the Trojans, stand behind the Argives. But now, look, he's leading the Trojan rampage, his pledges thrown to the winds!" With that challenge Athena levered Sthenelus out the back of the car. A twist of her wrist and the man hit the ground, springing aside as the goddess climbed aboard, blazing to fight beside the shining Diomedes. The big oaken axle groaned beneath the weight, bearing a great man and a terrifying goddess- and Pallas Athena seized the reins and whip, lashing the racing horses straight at Ares. The god was just stripping giant Periphas bare, the Aetolians' best fighter, Ochesius' noble son- the blood-smeared Ares was tearing off his gear but Athena donned the dark helmet of Death so not even stark Ares could see her now. But the butcher did see Tydeus' rugged son and he dropped gigantic Periphas on the spot where he'd just killed him, ripped his life away and Ares whirled at the stallion-breaking Diomedes— the two of them closing fast, charging face-to-face and the god thrust first, over Tydides' yoke and reins, with bronze spear burning to take the fighter's life. But Athena, her eyes afire, grabbed the flying shaft, flicked it over the car and off it flew for nothing— and after him Diomedes yelled his war cry, lunging out with his own bronze spear and Pallas rammed it home, deep in Ares' bowels where the belt cinched him tight. There Diomedes aimed and stabbed, he gouged him down his glistening flesh and wrenched the spear back out and the brazen god of war let loose a shriek, roaring, thundering loud as nine, ten thousand combat soldiers shriek with Ares' fury when massive armies clash. A shudder swept all ranks, Trojans and Argives both, terror-struck by the shriek the god let loose, Ares whose lust for slaughter never dies. But now, wild as a black cyclone twisting out of a cloudbank, building up from the day's heat, blasts and towers- so brazen Ares looked to Tydeus' son Diomedes. Soaring up with the clouds to the broad sweeping sky he quickly gained the gods' stronghold, steep Olympus, and settling down by the side of Cronus' great son Zeus, his spirit racked with pain, Ares displayed the blood, the fresh immortal blood that gushed from his wound, and burst out in a flight of self-pity: "Father Zeus, aren't you incensed to see such violent brutal work? We everlasting gods . . . Ah what chilling blows we suffer-thanks to our own conflicting wills- whenever we show these mortal men some kindness. And we all must battle you— you brought that senseless daughter into the world, that murderous curse-forever bent on crimes! While all the rest of us, every god on Olympus bows down to you, each of us overpowered. But that girl— you never block her way with a word or action, never, you spur her on, since you, you gave her birth from your own head, that child of devastation! Just look at this reckless Diomedes now— Athena spurred him on to rave against the gods. First he lunges at Aphrodite, stabs her hand at the wrist then charges me—even me—like something superhuman! But I, I'm so fast on my feet I saved my life. Else for a good long while I'd have felt the pain, writhing among the corpses there, or soldiered on, weak as a breathless ghost, beaten down by bronze." But Zeus who marshals storm clouds lowered a dark glance and let loose at Ares: "No more, you lying, two-faced ... no more sidling up to me, whining here before me. You—I hate you most of all the Olympian gods. Always dear to your heart, strife, yes, and battles, the bloody grind of war. You have your mother's uncontrollable rage-incorrigible, that Hera—say what I will, I can hardly keep her down. Hera's urgings, I trust,' have made you suffer this. But I cannot bear to see you agonize so long. You are my child. To me your mother bore you. If you had sprung from another god, believe me, and grown into such a blinding devastation, long ago you'd have dropped below the Titans, deep in the dark pit." So great Zeus declared and ordered the healing god to treat the god of war. And covering over his wound with pain-killing drugs the Healer cured him: the god was never born to die. Quickly as fig-juice, pressed into bubbly, creamy milk, curdles it firm for the man who churns it round, so quickly he healed the violent rushing Ares. And Hebe washed him clean, dressed him in robes to warm his heart, and flanking the son of Cronus down he sat, Ares exultant in the glory of it all. And now the two returned to the halls of mighty Zeus— Hera of Argos, Boeotian Athena, guard of armies, both had stopped the murderous Ares' cutting men to pieces. So the clash of Achaean and Trojan troops was on its own, the battle in all its fury veering back and forth, careering down the plain as they sent their bronze lances hurtling side-to-side between the Simois' banks and Xanthus' swirling rapids. That Achaean bulwark giant Ajax came up first, broke the Trojan line and brought his men some hope, spearing the bravest man the Thracians fielded, Acamas tall and staunch, Eussorus' son. The first to hurl, Great Ajax hit the ridge of the helmet's horsehair crest—the bronze point stuck in Acamas' forehead pounding through the skull and the dark came swirling down to shroud his eyes. A shattering war cry! Diomedes killed off Axylus, Teuthras' son who had lived in rock-built Arisbe, a man of means and a friend to all mankind, at his roadside house he'd warm all comers in. But who of his guests would greet his enemy now, meet him face-to-face and ward off grisly death? Diomedes killed the man and his aide-in-arms at once, Axylus and Calesius who always drove his team- both at a stroke he drove beneath the earth. Euryalus killed Dresus, killed Opheltius, turned and went for Pedasus and Aesepus, twins the nymph of the spring Abarbarea bore Bucolion . . . Bucolion, son himself to the lofty King Laomedon, first of the line, though his mother bore the prince in secrecy and shadow. Tending his flocks one day Bucolion took the nymph in a strong surge of love and beneath his force she bore him twin sons. But now the son of Mecisteus hacked the force from beneath them both and loosed their gleaming limbs and tore the armor off the dead men's shoulders. Polypoetes braced for battle killed Astyalus— Winging his bronze spear Odysseus slew Pidytes bred in Percote, and Teucer did the same for the royal Aretaon— Ablerus went down too, under the flashing lance of Nestor's son Antilochus, and Elatus under the lord of men Agamemnon's strength— Elatus lived by the banks of rippling Satniois, in Pedasus perched on cliffs— The hero Leitus ran Phylacus down to ground at a dead run and Eurypylus killed Melanthius outright— But Menelaus lord of the war cry had caught Adrestus alive. Rearing, bolting in terror down the plain his horses snared themselves in tamarisk branches, splintered his curved chariot just at the pole's tip and breaking free they made a dash for the city walls where battle-teams by the drove stampeded back in panic. But their master hurled from the chariot, tumbling over the wheel and pitching facedown in the dust, and above him now rose Menelaus, his spear's long shadow looming. Adrestus hugged his knees and begged him, pleading, "Take me alive, Atrides, take a ransom worth my life! Treasures are piled up in my rich father's house, bronze and gold and plenty of well-wrought iron— father would give you anything, gladly, priceless ransom if only he learns I'm still alive in Argive ships!" His pleas were moving the heart in Menelaus, just at the point of handing him to an aide to take him back to the fast Achaean ships . . . when up rushed Agamemnon, blocking his way and shouting out, "So soft, dear brother, why? Why such concern for enemies? I suppose you got such tender loving care at home from the Trojans. Ah would to god not one of them could escape his sudden plunging death beneath our hands! No baby boy still in his mother's belly, not even he escape—all Ilium blotted out, no tears for their lives, no markers for their graves!" And the iron warrior brought his brother round— rough justice, fitting too. Menelaus shoved Adrestus back with a fist, powerful Agamemnon stabbed him in the flank and back on his side the fighter went, faceup. The son of Atreus dug a heel in his heaving chest and wrenched the ash spear out. And here came Nestor with orders ringing down the field: "My comrades— fighting Danaans, aides of Ares—no plunder now! Don't lag behind, don't fling yourself at spoils just to haul the biggest portion back to your ship. Now's the time for killing! Later, at leisure, strip the corpses up and down the plain!" So he ordered, spurring each man's nerve— and the next moment crowds of Trojans once again would have clambered back inside their city walls, terror-struck by the Argives primed for battle. But Helenus son of Priam, best of the seers who scan the flight of birds, came striding up to Aeneas and Hector, calling out, "My captains! You bear the brunt of Troy's and Lycia's fighting— you are our bravest men, whatever the enterprise, pitched battle itself or planning our campaigns, so stand your ground right here! Go through the ranks and rally all the troops. Hold back our retreating mobs outside the gates before they throw themselves in their women's arms in fear, a great joy to our enemies closing for the kill. And once you've roused our lines to the last man, we'll hold out here and fight the Argives down, hard-hit as we are—necessity drives us on. But you, Hector, you go back to the city, tell our mother to gather all the older noble women together in gray-eyed Athena's shrine on the city's crest, unlock the doors of the goddess' sacred chamber— and take a robe, the largest, loveliest robe that she can find throughout the royal halls, a gift that far and away she prizes most herself, and spread it out across the sleek-haired goddess' knees. Then promise to sacrifice twelve heifers in her shrine, yearlings never broken, if only she'll pity Troy, the Trojan wives and all our helpless children, if only she'll hold Diomedes back from the holy city— that wild spearman, that invincible headlong terror! He is the strongest Argive now, I tell you. Never once did we fear Achilles so, captain of armies, born of a goddess too, or so they say. But here's a maniac run amok— no one can match his fury man-to-man!" So he urged and Hector obeyed his brother start to finish. Down he leapt from his chariot fully armed, hit the ground and brandishing two sharp spears went striding down his lines, ranging flank to flank, driving his fighters into battle, rousing grisly war-and round the Trojans whirled, bracing to meet the Argives face-to-face. And the Argives gave way, they quit the slaughter- they thought some god swept down from the starry skies to back the Trojans now, they wheeled and rallied so. Hector shouted out to his men in a piercing voice, "Gallant-hearted Trojans and far-famed allies! Now be men, my friends, call up your battle-fury! Till I can return to Troy and tell them all, the old counselors, all our wives, to pray to the gods and vow to offer them many splendid victims." As Hector turned for home his helmet flashed and the long dark hide of his bossed shield, the rim running the metal edge, drummed his neck and ankles. And now Glaucus son of Hippolochus and Tydeus' son Diomedes met in the no man's land between both armies: burning for battle, closing, squaring off and the lord of the war cry Diomedes opened up, "Who are you, my fine friend?-another born to die? I've never noticed you on the lines where we win glory, not till now. But here you come, charging out in front of all the rest with such bravado- daring to face the flying shadow of my spear. Pity the ones whose sons stand up to me in war! But if you are an immortal come from the blue, I'm not the man to fight the gods of heaven. Not even Dryas' indestructible son Lycurgus, not even he lived long . . . that fellow who tried to fight the deathless gods. He rushed at the maenads once, nurses of wild Dionysus, scattered them breakneck down the holy mountain Nysa. A rout of them strewed their sacred staves on the ground, raked with a cattle prod by Lycurgus, murderous fool! And Dionysus was terrified, he dove beneath the surf where the sea-nymph Thetis pressed him to her breast— Dionysus numb with fear: shivers racked his body, thanks to the raucous onslaught of that man. But the gods who live at ease lashed out against him— worse, the son of Cronus struck Lycurgus blind. Nor did the man live long, not' with the hate. of all the gods against him. No, my friend, I have no desire to fight the blithe immortals. But if you're a man who eats the crops of the earth, a mortal born for death-here, come closer, the sooner you will meet your day to die!" The noble son of Hippolochus answered staunchly, "High-hearted son of Tydeus, why ask about my birth? Like the generations of leaves, the lives of mortal men. Now the wind scatters the old leaves across the earth, now the living timber bursts with the new buds and spring comes round again. And so with men: as one generation comes to life, another dies away. But about my birth, if you'd like to learn it well, first to last—though many people know it— here's my story . . . There is a city, Corinth, deep in a bend of Argos, good stallion-country where Sisyphus used to live, the wiliest man alive. Sisyphus, Aeolus' son, who had a son called Glaucus, and in his day Glaucus sired brave Bellerophon, a man without a fault. The gods gave him beauty and the fine, gallant traits that go with men. But Proetus plotted against him. Far stronger, the king in his anger drove him out of Argos, the kingdom Zeus had brought beneath his scepter. Proetus' wife, you see, was mad for Bellerophon, the lovely Antea lusted to couple with him, all in secret. Futile—she could never seduce the man's strong will, his seasoned, firm resolve. So straight to the king she went, blurting out her lies: ‘I wish you'd die, Proetus, if you don't kill Bellerophon! Bellerophon's bent on dragging me down with him in lust though I fight him all the way!' All of it false but the king seethed when he heard a tale like that. He balked at killing the man-he'd some respect at least but he quickly sent him off to Lycia, gave him tokens, murderous signs, scratched in a folded tablet, and many of them too, enough to kill a man. He told him to show them to Antea's father: that would mean his death. So off he went to Lycia, safe in the escort of the gods, and once he reached the broad highlands cut by the rushing Xanthus, the king of Lycia gave him a royal welcome. Nine days he feasted him, nine oxen slaughtered. When the tenth Dawn shone with her rose-red fingers, he began to question him, asked to see his credentials, whatever he brought him from his in-law, Proetus. But then, once he received that fatal message sent from his own daughter's husband, first he ordered Bellerophon to kill the Chimaera- grim monster sprung of the gods, nothing human, all lion in front, all snake behind, all goat between, terrible, blasting lethal fire at every breath! But he laid her low, obeying signs from the gods. Next he fought the Solymi, tribesmen bent on glory, roughest battle of men he ever entered, so he claimed. Then for a third test he brought the Amazons down, a match for men in war. But as he turned back, his host spun out the tightest trap of all: picking the best men from Lycia far and wide he set an ambush—that never came hone again! Fearless Bellerophon killed them all. Then, yes, when the king could see the man's power at last, a true son of the gods, he pressed him hard to stay, he ofi'ered his own daughter's hand in marriage, he gave him half his royal honors as the king. And the Lycians carved him out a grand estate, the choicest land in the realm, rich in vineyards and good tilled fields for him to lord it over. And his wife bore good Bellerophon three children: Isander, Hippolochus and Laodamia. Laodamia lay in the arms of Zeus who rules the world and she bore the god a son, our great commander, Sarpedon helmed in bronze. But the day soon came when even Bellerophon was hated by all the gods. Across the Alean plain he wandered, all alone, eating his heart out, a fugitive on the run from the beaten tracks of men. His son Isander? Killed by the War-god, never sated—a boy fighting the Solymi always out for glory. Laodamia? Artemis, flashing her golden reins, cut her down in anger. But Hippolochus fathered me, I'm proud to say. He sent me off to Troy . . . and I hear his urgings ringing in my ears: 'Always be the best, my boy, the bravest, and hold your head up high above the others. Never disgrace the generation of your fathers. They were the bravest champions born in Corinth, in Lycia far and wide.' There you have my lineage. That is the blood I claim, my royal birth." When he heard that, Diomedes' spirits lifted. Raising his spear, the lord of the war cry drove it home, planting it deep down in the earth that feeds us all and with winning words he called out to Glaucus, the young captain, "Splendid-you are my friend, my guest from the days of our grandfathers long ago! Noble Oeneus hosted your brave Bellerophon once, he held him there in his halls, twenty whole days, and they gave each other handsome gifts of friendship. My kinsman offered a gleaming sword-belt, rich red, Bellerophon gave a cup, two-handled, solid gold— I left it at home when I set out for Troy. My father, Tydeus, I really don't remember. I was just a baby when father left me then, that time an Achaean army went to die at Thebes. So now I am your host and friend in the heart of Argos, you are mine in Lycia when I visit in your country. Come, let us keep clear of each other's spears, even there in the thick of battle. Look, plenty of Trojans there for me to kill, your famous allies too, any soldier the god will bring in range or I can run to ground. And plenty of Argives too—kill them if you can. But let's trade armor. The men must know our claim: we are sworn friends from our fathers' days till now!" Both agreed. Both fighters sprang from their chariots, clasped each other's hands and traded pacts of friendship. But the son of Cronus, Zeus, stole Glaucus' wits away. He traded his gold armor for bronze with Diomedes, the worth of a hundred oxen just for nine. And now, when Hector reached the Scaean Gates and the great oak, the wives and daughters of Troy came rushing up around him, asking about their sons, brothers, friends and husbands. But Hector told them only, "Pray to the gods"— all the Trojan women, one after another . . . Hard sorrows were hanging over many. And soon he came to Priam's palace, that magnificent structure built wide with porches and colonnades of polished stone. And deep within its walls were fifty sleeping chambers masoned in smooth, lustrous ashlar, linked in a line where the sons of Priam slept beside their wedded wives, and facing these, opening out across the inner courtyard, lay the twelve sleeping chambers of Priam's daughters, masoned and roofed in lustrous ashlar, linked in a line where the sons-in-law of Priam slept beside their wives. And there at the palace Hector's mother met her son, that warm, goodhearted woman, going in with Laodice, the loveliest daughter Hecuba ever bred. His mother clutched his hand and urged him, called his name: "My child-why have you left the bitter fighting, why have you come home? Look how they wear you out, the sons of Achaea—curse them—battling round our walls! And that's why your spirit brought you back to Troy, to climb the heights and stretch your arms to Zeus. But wait, I'll bring you some honeyed, mellow wine. First pour out cups to Father Zeus and the other gods, then refresh yourself, if you'd like to quench your thirst. When a Man's exhausted, wine will build his strength— battle-weary as you are, fighting for your people." But Hector shook his head, his helmet flashing: "Don't offer me mellow wine, mother, not now- you'd sap my limbs, I'd lose my nerve for war. And I'd be ashamed to pour a glistening cup to Zeus with unwashed hands. I'm splattered with blood and filth- how could I pray to the lord of storm and lightning? No, mother, you are the one to pray. Go to Athena's shrine, the queen of plunder, go with offerings, gather the older noble women and take a robe, the largest, loveliest robe that you can find throughout the royal halls, a gift that far and away you prize most yourself, and spread it out across the sleek-haired goddess' knees. Then promise to sacrifice twelve heifers in her shrine, yearlings never broken, if only she'll pity Troy, the Trojan wives and all our helpless children, if only she'll hold Diomedes back from the holy city- that wild spearman, that invincible headlong terror! Now, mother, go to the queen of plunder's shrine and I'll go hunt for Paris, summon him to fight if the man will hear what I have to say . . . Let the earth gape and swallow him on the spot! A great curse Olympian Zeus let live and grow in him, for Troy and high-hearted Priam and all his sons. That man—if I could see him bound for the House of Death, I could say my heart had forgot its wrenching grief!" But his mother simply turned away to the palace. She gave her servants orders and out they strode to gather the older noble women through the city. Hecuba went down to a storeroom filled with scent and there they were, brocaded, beautiful robes . . . the work of Sidonian women. Magnificent Paris brought those women back himself from Sidon, sailing the open seas on the same long voyage he swept Helen off, her famous Father's child. Lifting one from the lot, Hecuba brought it out for great Athena's gift, the largest, loveliest, richly worked, and like a star it glistened, deep beneath the others. Then she made her way with a file of noble women rushing in her train. Once they reached Athena's shrine on the city crest the beauty Theano opened the doors to let them in, Cisseus' daughter, the horseman Antenor's wife and Athena's priestess chosen by the Trojans. Then- with a shrill wail they all stretched their arms to Athena as Theano, her face radiant, lifting the robe on high, spread it out across the sleek-haired goddess' knees and prayed to the daughter of mighty Father Zeus: "Queen Athena—shield of our city-glory of goddesses! Now shatter the spear of Diomedes! That wild man- hurl him headlong down before the Scaean Gates! At once we'll sacrifice twelve heifers in your shrine, yearlings never broken, if only you'll pity Troy, the Trojan wives and all our helpless children!" But Athena refused to hear Theano's prayers. And while they prayed to the daughter of mighty Zeus Hector approached the halls of Paris, sumptuous halls he built himself with the finest masons of the day, master builders famed in the fertile land of Troy. They'd raised his sleeping chamber, house and court adjoining Priam's and Hector's aloft the city heights. Now Hector, dear to Zeus, strode through the gates, clutching a thrusting-lance eleven forearms long; the bronze tip of the weapon shone before him, ringed with a golden hoop to grip the shaft. And there in the bedroom Hector came on Paris polishing, fondling his splendid battle-gear, his shield and breastplate, turning over and over his long curved bow. And there was Helen of Argos, sitting with all the women of the house, directing the rich embroidered work they had in hand. Seeing Paris, Hector raked his brother with insults, stinging taunts: "What on earth are you doing? Oh how wrong it is, this anger you keep smoldering in your heart! Look, your people dying around the city, the steep walls, dying in arms-and all for you, the battle cries and the fighting flaring up around the citadel. You'd be the first to lash out at another—anywhere— you saw hanging back from this, this hateful war. Up with you— before all Troy is torched to a cinder here and now!" And Paris, magnificent as a god, replied, "Ah Hector, you criticize me fairly, yes, nothing unfair, beyond what I deserve. And so I will try to tell you something. Please bear with me, hear me out. It's not so much from anger or outrage at our people that I keep to my rooms so long. I only wanted to plunge myself in grief. But just now my wife was bringing me round, her winning words urging me back to battle. And it strikes me, even me, as the better way. Victory shifts, you know, now one man, now another. So come, wait while I get this war-gear on, or you go on ahead and I will follow— I think I can overtake you." Hector, helmet flashing, answered nothing. And Helen spoke to him now, her soft voice welling up: "My dear brother, dear to me, bitch that I am, vicious, scheming- horror to freeze the heart! Oh how I wish that first day my mother brought me into the light some black whirlwind had rushed me out to the mountains or into the surf where the roaring breakers crash and drag and the waves had swept me off before all this had happened! But since the gods ordained it all, these desperate years, I wish I had been the wife of a better man, someone alive to outrage, the withering scorn of men. This one has no steadiness in his spirit, not now, he never will . . . and he's going to reap the fruits of it, I swear. But come in, rest on this seat with me, dear brother. You are the one hit hardest by the fighting, Hector, you more than all—and all for me, whore that I am, and this blind mad Paris. Oh the two of us! Zeus planted a killing doom within us both, so even for generations still unborn we will live in song." Turning to go, his helmet flashing, tall Hector answered, "Don't ask 'me to sit beside you here, Helen. Love me as you do, you can't persuade me now. No time for rest. My heart races to help our Trojans— they long for me, sorely, whenever I am gone. But rouse this fellow, won't you? And let him hurry himself along as well, so he can overtake me before I leave the city. For I must go home to see my people first, to visit my own dear wife and my baby son. Who knows if I will ever come back to them again?— or the deathless gods will strike me down at last at the hands of Argive fighters." A flash of his helmet and off he strode and quickly reached his sturdy, well-built house. But white-armed Andromache- Hector could not find her in the halls. She and the boy and a servant finely gowned were standing watch on the tower, sobbing, grieving. When Hector saw no sign of his loyal wife inside he went to the doorway, stopped and asked the servants, "Come, please, tell me the truth now, women. Where's Andromache gone? To my sisters' house? To my brothers' wives with their long flowing robes? Or Athena's shrine where the noble Trojan women gather to win the great grim goddess over?" A busy, willing servant answered quickly, "Hector, seeing you want to know the truth, she hasn't gone to your sisters, brothers' wives or Athena's shrine where the noble Trojan women gather to win the great grim goddess over. Up to the huge gate-tower of Troy she's gone because she heard our men are so hard-pressed, the Achaean fighters coming on in so much force. She sped to the wall in panic, like a madwoman— the nurse went with her, carrying your child." At that, Hector spun and rushed from his house, back by the same way down the wide, well-paved streets throughout the city until he reached the Scaean Gates, the last point he would pass to gain the field of battle. There his warm, generous wife came running up to meet him, Andromache the daughter of gallant-hearted Eetion who had lived below Mount Placos rich with timber, in Thebe below the peaks, and ruled Cilicia's people. His daughter had married Hector helmed in bronze. She joined him now, and following in her steps a servant holding the boy against her breast, in the first flush of life, only a baby, Hector's son, the darling of his eyes and radiant as a star . . . Hector would always call the boy Scamandrius, townsmen called him Astyanax, Lord of the City, since Hector was the lone defense of Troy. The great man of war breaking into a broad smile, his gaze fixed on his son, in silence. Andromache, pressing close beside him and weeping freely now, clung to his hand, urged him, called him: "Reckless one, my Hector-your own fiery courage will destroy you! Have you no pity for him, our helpless son? Or me, and the destiny that weighs me down, your widow, now so soon? Yes, soon they will kill you off, all the Achaean forces massed for assault, and then, bereft of you, better for me to sink beneath the earth. What other warmth, what comfort's left for me, once you have met your doom? Nothing but torment! I have lost my father. Mother's gone as well. Father . . . the brilliant Achilles laid him low when he stormed Cilicia's city filled with people, Thebe with her towering gates. He killed Eetion, not that he stripped his gear-he'd some respect at least— for he burned his corpse in all his blazoned bronze, then heaped a grave-mound high above the ashes and nymphs of the mountain planted elms around it, daughters of Zeus whose shield is storm and thunder. And the seven brothers I had within our halls . . . all in the same day went down to the House of Death, the great godlike runner Achilles butchered them all, tending their shambling oxen, shining flocks. And mother, who ruled under the timberline of woody Placos once— he no sooner haled her here with his other plunder than he took a priceless ransom, set her free and home she went to her father's royal halls where Artemis, showering arrows, shot her down. You, Hector-you are my father now, my noble mother, a brother too, and you are my husband, young and warm and strong! Pity me, please! Take your stand on the rampart here, before you orphan your son and make your wife a widow. Draw your armies up where the wild fig tree stands, there, where the city lies most open to assault, the walls lower, easily overrun. Three times they have tried that point, hoping to storm Troy, their best fighters led by the Great and Little Ajax, famous Idomeneus, Atreus' sons, valiant Diomedes. Perhaps, a skilled prophet revealed the spot— or their own fury whips them on to attack." And tall Hector nodded, his helmet flashing: "All this weighs on my mind too, dear woman. But I would die of shame to face the men of Troy and the Trojan women trailing their long robes if I would shrink from battle now, a coward. Nor does the spirit urge me on that way. I've learned it all too well. To stand up bravely, always to fight in the front ranks of Trojan soldiers, winning my father great glory, glory for myself. For in my heart and soul I also know this well: the day will come when sacred Troy must die, Priam must die and all his people with him, Priam who hurls the strong ash spear . . . Even so, it is less the pain of the Trojans still to come that weighs me down, not even of Hecuba herself or King Priam, or the thought that my own brothers in all their numbers, all their gallant courage, may tumble in the dust, crushed by enemies- That is nothing, nothing beside your agony when some brazen Argive hales you off in tears, wrenching away your day of light and freedom! Then far off in the land of Argos you must live, laboring at a loom, at another woman's beck and call, fetching water at some spring, Messeis or Hyperia, resisting it all the way— the rough yoke of necessity at your neck. And a man may say, who sees you streaming tears, 'There is the wife of Hector, the bravest fighter they could field, those stallion-breaking Trojans, long ago when the men fought .for Troy.' So he will say and the fresh grief will swell your heart once more, widowed, robbed of the one man strong enough to fight off your day of slavery. No, no, let the earth come piling over my dead body before I hear your cries, I hear you dragged away!" In the same breath, shining Hector reached down for his son—but the boy recoiled, cringing against his nurse's full breast, screaming out at the sight of his own father, terrified by the flashing bronze, the horsehair crest, the great ridge of the helmet nodding, bristling terror- so it struck his eyes. And his loving father laughed, his mother laughed as well, and glorious Hector, quickly lifting the helmet from his head, set it down on the ground, fiery in the sunlight, and raising his son he kissed him, tossed him in his arms, lifting a prayer to Zeus and the other deathless gods: "Zeus, all you immortals! Grant this boy, my son, may be like me, first in glory among the Trojans, strong and brave like me, and rule all Troy in power and one day let them say, 'He is a better man than his father!'— when he comes home from battle bearing the bloody gear of the mortal enemy he has killed in war— a joy to his mother's heart." So Hector prayed and placed his son in the arms of his loving wife. Andromache pressed the child to her scented breast, smiling through her tears. Her husband noticed, and filled with pity now, Hector stroked her gently, trying to reassure her, repeating her name: "Andromache, dear one, why so desperate? Why so much grief for me? No man will hurl me down to Death, against my fate. And fate? No one alive has ever escaped it, neither brave man nor coward, I tell you— it's born with us the day that we are born. So please go home and tend to your own tasks, the distaff and the loom, and keep the women working hard as well. As for the fighting, men will see to that, all who were born in Troy but I most of all." Hector aflash in arms took up his horsehair-crested helmet once again. And his loving wife went home, turning, glancing back again and again and weeping live warm tears. She quickly reached the sturdy house of Hector, man-killing Hector, and found her women gathered there inside and stirred them all to a high pitch of mourning. So in his house they raised the dirges for the dead, for Hector still alive, his people were so convinced that never again would he come home from battle, never escape the Argives' rage and bloody hands. Nor did Paris linger long in his vaulted halls. Soon as he buckled on his elegant gleaming bronze he rushed through Troy, sure in his racing stride. As a stallion full-fed at the manger, stalled too long, breaking free of his tether gallops down the plain, out for his favorite plunge in a river's cool currents, thundering in his pride-his head flung back, his mane streaming over his shoulders, sure and sleek in his glory, knees racing him on to the fields and stallion-haunts he loves— so down from Pergamus heights came Paris, son of Priam, glittering in his armor like the sun astride the skies, exultant, laughing aloud, his fast feet sped him on. Quickly he overtook his brother, noble Hector still lingering, slow to turn from the spot where he had just confided in his wife . . . Magnificent Paris spoke first: "Dear brother, look at me, holding you back in all your speed— dragging my feet; coming to you so late, and you told me to be quick!" A flash of his helmet as Hector shot back, "Impossible man! How could anyone fair and just underrate your work in battle? You're a good soldier. But you hang back of your own accord, refuse to fight. And that, that's why the heart inside me aches when I hear our Trojans heap contempt on you, the men who bear such struggles all for you. Come, now for attack! We'll set all this to rights, someday, if Zeus will ever let us raise the winebowl of freedom high in our halls, high to the gods of cloud and sky who live forever— once we drive these Argives geared for battle out of Troy!" Vaunting, aflash in arms, Hector swept through the gates with his brother Paris keeping pace beside him. Both men bent on combat, on they fought like wind when a god sends down some welcome blast to sailors desperate for it, worked to death at the polished oars, beating the heavy seas, their arms slack with the labor- so welcome that brace of men appeared to the Trojans desperate for their captains. Each one killed his man. Paris took Menesthius, one who had lived in Arne, a son of King Areithous lord of the war-club and his lady Phylomedusa with large lovely eyes. Hector slashed Eioneus' throat with a sharp spear, ripped him under the helmet's hammered bronze rim- his legs collapsed in death. Quick in the jolting onset Lycia's captain Glaucus son of Hippolochus skewered Dexius' son Iphinous just as he leapt behind his fast mares-he stabbed his shoulder, hard, and down from his car Iphinous crashed to earth and his limbs went slack with death. Rampaging Trojans! Yes, but as soon as fiery-eyed Athena marked them killing Argive ranks in this all-out assault, down she rushed from the peaks of Mount Olympus straight for sacred Troy. But Phoebus Apollo spotting her from Pergamus heights-the god grim set on victory for the Trojans-rose to intercept her . . . As the two came face-to-face beside the great oak, lord Apollo the son of Zeus led off, "What next?— what is the mighty Zeus's daughter blazing after now? Down from Olympus, what heroics stir your heart? No doubt you'll hand your Argives victory soon, you'll turn the tide of battle! You have no mercy, none for dying Trojans. Come, listen to me-my plan is so much better: let us halt the war and the heat of combat now, at least for today. They'll fight again tomorrow, until they win their way to the fixed doom of Troy, since that is your only passion-you two goddesses— to plunder Troy to rubble." Athena's eyes lit up and the goddess said, "So be it, archer of the sky! Those were my very thoughts, winging down from Olympus into the midst of Trojans and Achaeans. But tell me, how do you hope to stop the men from fighting?" "Hector!"—lord Apollo the son of Zeus replied- "We'll spur his nerve and strength, that breaker of horses, see if he'll challenge one of the Argives man-to-man and they will duel in bloody combat to the death. Achaeans armed in bronze will thrill to his call, they'll put up a man to battle shining Hector." So Apollo staged the action. Her eyes afire the goddess Pallas did not resist a moment. She flashed the word in Helens' mantic spirit- the son of Priam sensed what pleased the immortals hatching instant plans, and coming up to Hector advised him quickly, "Hector, son of Priam, a mastermind like Zeus, listen to me now- let your brother guide you. Have all Trojans and Argives take their seats, and you, you challenge Achaea's bravest man to duel in bloody combat to the death. It's not the hour to meet your doom, not yet. I heard a voice of the gods who live forever." When Hector heard that challenge he rejoiced and right in the no man's land along his lines he strode, gripping his spear mid-haft, staving men to a standstill while Agamemnon seated his Argives geared for combat. And Apollo lord of the silver bow and Queen Athena, for all the world like carrion birds, like vultures, slowly settled atop the broad towering oak sacred to Zeus whose battle-shield is thunder, relishing those men. Wave on wave of them settling, close ranks shuddering into a dense, bristling glitter of shields and spears and helmets—quick as a ripple the West Wind suddenly risen shudders down the sea and the deep sea swell goes dark beneath its force— so settling waves of Trojan ranks and Achaeans rippled down the plain . . . And Hector rose and spoke between both sides: "Hear me—Trojans, Achaeans geared for combat! I'll speak out what the heart inside me urges. Our oaths, our sworn truce—Zeus the son of Cronus throned in the clouds has brought them all to nothing and all the Father decrees is death for both sides at once. Until you Argives seize the well-built towers of Troy or you yourselves are crushed against your ships. But now, seeing the best of all Achaeans fill your ranks, let one whose nerve impels him to fight with me come striding from your lines, a lone champion pitted against Prince Hector. Here are the terms that I set forth-let Zeus look down, my witness! If that man takes my life with his sharp bronze blade, he will strip my gear and haul it back to his ships. But give my body to friends to carry home again, so Trojan men and Trojan women can do me honor with fitting rites of fire once I am dead. But if I kill him and Apollo grants me glory, I'll strip his gear and haul it back to sacred Troy and hang it high on the deadly Archer's temple walls. But not his body: I'll hand it back to the decked ships, so the long-haired Achaeans can give him full rites and heap his barrow high by the broad Hellespont. And someday one will say, one of the men to come, steering his oar-swept ship across the wine-dark sea, 'There's the mound of a man who died in the old days, one of the brave whom glorious Hector killed.' So they will say, someday, and my fame will never die." A hushed silence went through all the Achaean ranks, ashamed to refuse, afraid to take his challenge . . . But at long last Menelaus leapt up and spoke, lashing out at them, groaning, heartsick: "Oh no— your threats, your bluster—women, not men of Achaea! What disgrace it will be—shame, cringing shame if not one Danaan now steps up to battle Hector. You can all turn to earth and water-rot away! Look at each of you, sitting there, lifeless, lust for glory gone. I'll harness up, I'll fight the man myself. The gods on high- they hold the ropes of victory in their hands!" With that he began to don his handsome gear. And then and there, Menelaus, the death-stroke would have blazed before your eyes— dead at the hands of Hector, a far stronger man— if Argive kings had not leapt up and caught you. And Atreus' son himself, powerful Agamemnon seized your right hand, shouting out your name: "You're mad, my Prince! No need for such an outburst— get a grip on yourself, distraught as you are. Just for the sake of rivalry, soldier's pride, don't rush to fight with a better man, with Hector the son of Priam. Many others shrink before him. Even Achilles dreads to pit himself against him out on the battle lines where men win glory— Achilles, far and away a stronger man than you. Go back. Sit down with the comrades you command. We'll put up another champion to go against this Hector. Fearless, is he? and never sated with fighting? He'll gladly sink to a knee and rest, I'd say, if the man comes through alive from the fight he begs for, dueling to the death." Again the iron warrior brought his brother round— good counsel, fitting too. Menelaus yielded at once. His aides, elated, lifted the armor off his shoulders. And then lord Nestor rose and spoke among the men: "No more-or enormous sorrow comes to all Achaea! How he would groan at this, the old horseman Peleus, that fine speaker, the Myrmidons' famed commander. How he rejoiced that day, questioning me in his halls, when he learned the blood and birth of all the Argives. Now if he heard how all cringe in the face of Hector, time and again he'd stretch his hands to the gods and pray that life breath would quit his limbs and sink to the House of Death. Oh if only— Father Zeus, Athena, Apollo-I were young again! Fresh as the day we fought by Celadon's rapids, our Pylians in platoons against Arcadian spearmen under Phia's ramparts, round the Iardanus' banks. When Arcadia's champion Ereuthalion strode forth, a man like a god for power, his shoulders decked with King Areithous' armor, massive Areithous . . . the Great War-club, so they called that hulk, his men-at-arms and their sashed and lovely women. He would never fight with a bow or long spear, no, with his giant iron club he'd break battalions open. That monster—Lycurgus cut him down by stealth, not force at all, on a footpath so cramped his iron club was useless fending off his death. There-before he could heft it-a sudden lunge and Lycurgus' spear had run him through the guts. Flat on his back he went, slamming against the ground and his killer stripped the armor brazen Ares gave him. He donned it himself, for years of grueling war, but then, when Lycurgus grew too old in his halls, he passed it on to a favorite henchman, Ereuthalion, and sporting that gear he challenged all our best. And they, they shook from head to foot, terrified, none with the nerve to face him then. Only I— my hardened courage drove me to fight the man in a hot burst of daring, and I the youngest trooper of us all . . . I took him on and Athena gave me glory. By heaven, Ereuthalion was the biggest, strongest man I ever killed, the huge lumbering sprawl of him stretching far and wide! Oh make me young again, and the strength inside me steady as a rock! Hector with that flashing helmet would meet his match in combat in a moment. You, the bravest of all Achaeans—and not one with the spine to battle Hector face-to-face!" The old man's taunts brought nine men to their feet. First by far Agamemnon lord of men sprang up and following him Tydides, powerful Diomedes, next. the Great and Little Ajax armed in fury, Idomeneus after them and Idomeneus' good aide, Meriones, a match for the butcher god of war, Eurypylus after them, Euaemon's gallant son, Thoas son of Andraemon, Odysseus out for exploit: all were roused to go up against Prince Hector. Once more the fine old horseman gave commands: "Now shake the lots for all, the first to the last man—we'll see who wins. He's the one to do his Achaean comrades proud, do himself proud too, if he comes through alive from the fight that waits him, dueling to the death." And each soldier scratched his mark on a stone and threw it into Atrides Agamemnon's helmet. Fighters prayed. Stretching hands to the gods a man would murmur, scanning the wide sky, "Father Zeus, let Ajax win, or Tydeus' son or the proud king himself of all Mycenae's gold!" So they prayed as the old horseman shook the lots and one leapt from the helmet, the one they wanted most— Great Ajax' lot it was. And the herald took it round through all the ranks, left to right for luck, and showed it to all Achaea's bravest men. None of them knew it, each denied the mark. But once he'd passed it round and reached the man who had scratched the stone and thrown it in the helmet— Ajax bent on glory-out went his hand to take it, the herald pausing beside him dropped it in and Ajax knew his mark and thrilled to see it, flung it down at his feet and shouted, "Friends- the lot is mine and it fills my heart with joy! I know I can overpower this dazzling Hector. But come, while I strap my battle-armor on, all of you pray to Cronus' son, almighty Zeus. Pray to yourselves in silence, so Trojans cannot hear— no, pray out loud! No one at all to fear. No one can rout me— his will against my will—not by force, god knows, and not by a sly maneuver either. I'm not such a raw recruit, I like to think, born and bred on Salamis." So Great Ajax vaunted and men prayed to the son of Cronus, King Zeus. They'd call out, scanning the wide sky, "Father Zeus— ruling over us all from Ida, god of greatness, glory! Now let Ajax take this victory, shining triumph! But if you love Hector, if you hold him dear, at least give both men equal strength and glory." So they prayed as Ajax harnessed himself in burnished, gleaming bronze and once he had strapped his legs and chest in armor, out he marched like the giant god of battle wading into the wars of men when Zeus drives them hard to clash and soldier on with heart-devouring hate. So giant Ajax marched, that bulwark of the Achaeans— a grim smile curling below his dark shaggy brows, under his legs' power taking immense strides, shaking his spear high, its long shadow trailing. The men of Argos exulted at the sight of him there but terrible tremors shook each Trojan fighter's knees— Hector himself, his heart pounding against his ribs. But how could he shrink before the enemy, slip back into a crowd of cohorts now? He was the challenger, he with his lust for battle. Ajax strode on, closing, bearing his huge body-shield like a rampart, heavy bronze over seven layers of oxhide. Tychius made it for him, laboring long, the finest leather-smith by far: over in Hyle where the master had his home he crafted that famous gleaming shield for Ajax, layering seven welted hides of sturdy well-fed bulls and hammered an eighth layer of bronze to top it off. And now holding that great shield before his chest Telamonian Ajax marched right up to Hector, threatening with his deep resounding voice, "Hector, now you'll learn, once and for all, in combat man-to-man, what kind of champions range the Argive ranks, even besides Achilles, that lionheart who mauls battalions wholesale. Off in his beaked seagoing ships Achilles lies, raging away at Agamemnon, marshal of armies— but here we are, strong enough to engage you, and plenty of us too. Come— lead off, if you can, with all your fighting power!" A flash of his helmet as. rangy Hector shook his head: "Ajax, royal son of Telamon, captain of armies, don't toy with me like a puny, weak-kneed boy or a woman never trained in works of war! War—I know it well, and the butchery of men. Well I know, shift to the left, shift to the right my tough tanned shield. That's what the real drill, defensive fighting means to me. I know it all, how to charge in the rush of plunging horses— I know how to stand and fight to the finish, twist and lunge in the War-god's deadly dance. On guard! Big and bluff as you are, I've no desire to hit you sniping in on the sly— I'd strike you out in the open, strike you now!" He hurled— his spear's long shadow flew and it struck Ajax' shield, that awesome seven-layered buckler, right on the eighth, the outside layer of bronze that topped it off, through six hides it tore but the seventh stopped the relentless brazen point. But Great Ajax next dear to the gods he hurled and his spear's shadow flew and the shaft hit Hector's round shield, hit full center— straight through the gleaming hide the heavy weapon drove, ripping down and in through the breastplate finely worked, tearing the war-shirt, close by Hector's flank it jabbed but the Trojan swerved aside and dodged black death. Both seized their lances, wrenched them from the shields and went for each other now like lions rending flesh or a pair of wild boars whose power never flags. Hector stabbed at the buckler, full center too, not smashing through, the brazen point bent back— and Ajax lunged at him, thrusting hard at his shield and the shaft punched through, rammed him back in his fury and grazed his neck and the dark blood gushed forth. But not even then did Hector quit the battle . . . backing, helmet flashing, his strong hand hefting a rock from the field, dark, jagged, a ton weight— he hurled it at Ajax, struck the gigantic shield, seven oxhides thick, struck right on the jutting boss and the bronze clanged, echoing round and round as Ajax hoisting a boulder—far larger—wheeled and heaved it, putting his weight behind it, tremendous force— and the rock crashed home, Hector's shield burst in, hit by a millstone-and Hector's fine knees buckled, flat on his back he went, his shield crushing down on him swept him off his feet. But Apollo quickly pulled him up- and now they'd have closed with swords, hacked each other if heralds of Zeus and men had not come rushing in, one from the Trojans, one from the armed Achaeans, Talthybius and Idaeus, both with good clear heads. Parting them, holding their staffs between both men, the herald Idaeus, cool, skilled in tactics, urged, "No more, my sons— don't kill yourselves in combat! Zeus who marshals the storm cloud loves you both. You're both great fighters—we all know that full well. The night comes on at last. Best to yield to night." But the giant Ajax answered briskly, "Wait, Idaeus, tell Hector here to call the truce. Mad for a fight, he challenged all our bravest. Let him lead off. I'll take his lead, you'll see." His helmet flashed as Hector nodded: "Yes, Ajax, since god has given you power, build and sense and you are the strongest spearman of Achaea, let us break off this dueling to the death, at least for today. We'll fight again tomorrow, until some fatal power decides between our armies, handing victory down to one side or another. Look, the night comes at last. Best to yield to night. So you will bring some joy to Achaea's forces camped beside their ships, and most of all to your own troops, the comrades you command. But I'll go back to the great city of King Priam and bring some joy to the men of Troy and Trojan women trailing their long robes. Thankful for my return they'll go to meet the gods and sing their praises. Come, let us give each other gifts, unforgettable gifts, so any man may say, Trojan soldier or Argive, 'First they fought with heart-devouring hatred, then they parted, bound by pacts of friendship.' " With that he gave him his silver-studded sword, slung in its sheath on a supple, well-cut sword-strap, and Ajax gave his war-belt, glistening purple. So both men parted, Ajax back to Achaea's armies, Hector back to his thronging Trojans—overjoyed to see. him still alive, unharmed, striding back, free of the rage and hands of Ajax still unconquered. They escorted him home to Troy—saved, past all their hopes— while far across the field the Achaean men-at-arms escorted Ajax, thrilled with victory, back to Agamemnon. Soon as they had gathered within the warlord's tents he sacrificed an ox in their midst, a full-grown ox, five years old, to the towering son of Cronus, Zeus. They skinned the animal quickly, butchered the carcass, expertly cut the meat into pieces, pierced them with spits, roasted them to a turn and pulled them off the fire. The work done, the feast laid out, they ate well and no man's hunger lacked a share of the banquet. But the lord of far-flung kingdoms, hero Agamemnon, honored giant Telamonian Ajax first and last with the long savory cuts that line the backbone. And when they had put aside desire for food and drink the old man began to weave his counsel among them: Nestor was first to speak—from the early days his plans and tactics always seemed the best. With good will to the lords he rose and spoke: "King Agamemnon, chiefs of all the Argives- how many long-haired Achaeans lie here dead! And now Ares the slashing god of war has swirled their dark blood in Scamander's deep clear stream and their souls have drifted down to the House of Death. So at dawn you must call a halt to fighting by Achaeans, form your units, bring on wagons, gather up the dead and wheel the corpses back with mules and oxen. Then, at a decent distance from the ships, we burn the bodies, so every soldier here can carry back the bones to a dead man's sons when he sails home again. And let us heap a single great barrow over the pyre, one great communal grave stretched out across the plain and fronting it throw up looming ramparts quickly, a landward wall for ships and troops themselves. And amidst the wall build gateways fitted strong to open a clear path for driving chariots through. And just outside the wall we must dig a trench, a deep ditch in a broad sweeping ring to block their horse and men and break their charge— then these headlong Trojans can never rush our armies." So he advised. All the warlords sounded their assent. And now the Trojans collected high on the crest of Troy. They were shaken, distracted men at Priam's gates but the clearheaded Anterior opened up among them: "Hear me, Trojans, Dardans, all our loyal allies, I must speak out what the heart inside me urges. On with it—give Argive Helen and all her treasures back to Atreus' sons to take away at last. We broke our sworn truce. We fight as outlaws. True, and what profit for us in the long run? Nothing—unless we do exactly as I say." So he pressed the point, then took his seat. But among them stood magnificent Paris now, fair-haired Helen's lord, and he came back with a winging burst in answer: "Stop, Anterior! No more of your hot insistence—it repels me. You must have something better than this to say. But if you are serious, speaking from the heart, the gods themselves have blotted out your senses. Now I say this to our stallion-breaking Trojans, I say No, straight out—I won't give up the woman! But those treasures I once hauled home from Argos, I'll return them all and add from my own stores." With that concession the prince sat down again. Then Priam the son of Dardanus rose among them, a man who could match the gods for strong advice, and with good will toward all he swayed his people: "Hear me, Trojans, Dardans, all our loyal allies- I must speak out what the heart inside me urges. Now take your evening meal throughout the city, just as you always have, and stand your watches, each man wide awake. And then, at first light, let the herald Idaeus go to the beaked ships and tell the Atridae, Agamemnon and Menelaus, the offer of Paris who caused our long hard campaign. Let Idaeus add this too, a good sound proposal: see if they are willing to halt the brutal war until we can bum the bodies of our dead. We'll fight again tomorrow . . . until some fatal power decides between us both, handing victory down to our side—or the other." His people hung on his words and all obeyed the king. They took their meal by ranks throughout the army. At first light Idaeus went to the beaked ships and out on the meeting grounds he found the Argives, veterans close by the stem of Agamemnon's ship. Taking his stand, right in the milling troops, the herald called out in a high, firm voice, "Son of Atreus! Captains of all Achaeans! Priam and noble Trojans command me to report, if it proves acceptable, pleasing to one and all, the offer of Paris who caused our long hard campaign. All the treasures that filled his hollow ships and the prince hauled home to Troy— would to god he'd drowned before that day!— he'll return them all and add from his own stores. But the lawful wife of Menelaus, renowned Menelaus, he will not give her up, Paris makes that clear, though all Troy commands him to do precisely that. They tell me to add this too, a good sound proposal: if you are willing, come, we'll halt the brutal war until we can bum the bodies of our dead. We'll fight again tomorrow— until some fatal power decides between us both, handing victory down to one side or the other." So he spoke and a hushed silence went through all the ranks. Finally Diomedes lord of the war cry shouted out, "No one touch the treasures of Paris, Helen either! It's obvious—any fool can see it. Now, at last, the neck of Troy's in the noose—her doom is sealed." All the Achaean soldiers roared out their assent, stirred by the stallion-breaking lord's reply, and King Agamemnon rounded on Idaeus: "There, there's the Achaeans' answer, Idaeus—a declaration— you can hear for yourself. It is my pleasure too. But about the dead, I'd never grudge their burning. No holding back for the bodies of the fallen: once they are gone, let fire soothe them quickly. That is my sworn pledge. Zeus my witness now, Hera's lord whose thunder drums the sky!" With that oath he raised his scepter high in the eyes of all the gods and Idaeus turned, trailing back to sacred Troy. There they sat in assembly, Trojans, Dardans, all collected together, waiting long and tense for the herald to return. And home Idaeus came, delivered his message standing in their midst and they fell to making hurried preparations, dividing the labors quickly—two detachments, one to gather the bodies, one the timber. And far on the other side Achaean troops came streaming out of the well-benched ships, some to gather the bodies, some the timber. Just as the sun began to strike the plowlands, rising out of the deep calm flow of the Ocean River to climb the vaulting sky, the opposing armies met. And hard as it was to recognize each man, each body, with clear water they washed the clotted blood away and lifted them onto wagons, weeping warm tears. Priam forbade his people to wail aloud. In silence they piled the corpses on the pyre, their hearts breaking, burned them down to ash and returned to sacred Troy. And just so on the other side Achaean men-at-arms piled the corpses on the pyre, their hearts breaking, burned them down to ash and returned to the hollow ships. Then with the daybreak not quite risen into dawn, the night and day still deadlocked, round the pyre a work brigade of picked Achaeans grouped. They heaped a single great barrow over the corpse-fire, one great communal grave stretched out across the plain and fronting it threw up looming ramparts quickly, a landward wall for ships and troops themselves, and amidst the wall built gateways fitted strong to open a clear path for driving chariots through. And against the fortress, just outside the wall, the men dug an enormous trench, broad and deep, and drove sharp stakes to guard it. So they labored, the long-haired Achaeans, while the gods aloft, seated at ease beside the lord of lightning, Zeus, gazed down on the grand work of Argives armed in bronze. Poseidon the god whose breakers shake the land began, "Father Zeus, is there a man on the whole wide earth who still informs the gods of all his plans, his schemes? Don't you see? Look there—the long-haired Achaeans have flung that rampart up against their ships, around it they have dug an enormous deep trench and never offered the gods a hundred splendid bulls, but its fame will spread as far as the light of dawnl And men will forget those ramparts I and Apollo reared for Troy in the old days— for the hero Laomedon—we broke our backs with labor." But filled with anger, Zeus who marshals the thunderheads let loose now: "Unbelievable! God of the earthquake, you with your massive power, why are you moaning so? Another god might fear their wall—their idle whim— one far weaker than you in strength of hand and fury. Your own fame goes spreading far as the light of dawn. Come now, just wait till these long-haired Achaeans sail back in their ships to the fatherland they love, then batter their wall, sweep it into the salt breakers and pile over the endless beach your drifts of sand again, level it to your heart's content—the Argives' mighty wall." So they conferred together, building their resolve. The sun went down. The Argives' work was finished. They slew oxen beside the tents and took their meal. And the ships pulled in from Lemnos bringing wine, a big convoy sent across by Euneus, Jason's son whom Hypsipyle bore the seasoned lord of armies. An outright gift to Atrides Agamemnon and Menelaus, Euneus gave a shipment of wine, a thousand measures full. From the rest Achaean soldiers bought their rations, some with bronze and some with gleaming iron, some with hides, some with whole live cattle, some with slaves, and they made a handsome feast. Then all that night the long-haired Achaeans feasted as Trojans and Trojan allies took their meal in Troy. Yes, but all night long the Master Strategist Zeus plotted fresh disaster for both opposing armies— his thunder striking terror— and blanching panic swept across the ranks. They flung wine from their cups and wet the earth and no fighter would dare drink until he'd poured an offering out to the overwhelming son of Cronus. Then down they lay at last and took the gift of sleep. Now as the Dawn flung out her golden robe across the earth Zeus who loves the lightning summoned all the gods to assembly on the topmost peak of ridged Olympus. He harangued the immortals hanging on his words: "Hear me, all you gods and all goddesses too, as I proclaim what the heart inside me urges. Let no lovely goddess—and no god either— try to fight against my strict decree. All submit to it now, so all the more quickly I can bring this violent business to an end. And any god I catch, breaking ranks with us, eager to go and help the Trojans or Achaeans— back he comes to Olympus, whipped by the lightning, eternally disgraced. Or I will snatch and hurl him down to the murk of Tartarus half the world away, the deepest gulf that yawns beneath the ground, there where the iron gates and brazen threshold loom, as far below the House of Death as the sky rides over earth— then he will know how far my power tops all other gods' Come, try me, immortals, so all of you can learn. Hang a great golden cable down from the heavens, lay hold of it, all you gods, all goddesses too: you can never drag me down from sky to earth, not Zeus, the highest, mightiest king of kings, not even if you worked yourselves to death. But whenever I'd set my mind to drag you up, in deadly earnest, I'd hoist you all with ease, you and the earth, you and the sea, all together, then loop that golden cable round a horn of Olympus, bind it fast and leave the whole world dangling in mid-air— that is how far I tower over the gods, I tower over men." A stunned silence seized them all, struck dumb— Zeus's ringing pronouncements overwhelmed them so. But finally clear-eyed Athena rose and spoke: "Our Father, son of Cronus, high and mighty, we already know your power, far too well . . . who can stand against you? Even so, we pity these Argive spearmen living out their grim fates, dying in blood. Yes, we'll keep clear of the war as you command. We'll simply offer the Argives tactics that may save them— so they won't all fall beneath your blazing wrath." Zeus who drives the storm clouds smiled and answered, "Courage, Athena, third-born of the gods, dear child. Nothing I said was meant in earnest—trust me, I mean you all the good will in the world." With that, he harnessed his bronze-hoofed horses onto his battle-car, his pair that raced the wind with their golden manes streaming on behind them, and strapping golden armor around his body, Zeus himself took up his whip that coils lithe and gold and climbed aboard. A crack of the lash—the team plunged to a run and on the stallions flew, holding nothing back as they winged between the earth and starry skies and gaining the slopes of Ida with all her springs, the mother of wild beasts, they reached Gargaron peak where the grove of Zeus and Zeus's smoking altar stand. There the father of men and gods reined in his team, set them free and around them poured a dense mist. And Zeus assumed his throne on the mountaintop, exulting in all his glory, gazing out over the city walls of Troy and the warships of Achaea. Quickly the long-haired Achaeans took their meal throughout the shelters, then they armed at once. And on their side the Trojans put on harness too, mustering throughout the city, a smaller force but nerved to engage in combat even so-- necessity pressed them to fight for sons and wives. All the gates flung wide and the Trojan mass surged out, horses, chariots, men on foot—a tremendous roar went up. And now as the armies clashed at one strategic point they slammed their shields together, pike scraped pike with the grappling strength of fighters armed in bronze and their round shields' bosses pounded hide-to-hide and the thunder of struggle roared and rocked the earth. Screams of men and cries of triumph breaking in one breath, fighters killing, fighters killed, and the ground streamed blood. As long as morning rose and the blessed day grew stronger, the weapons hurtled side-to-side and men kept falling. But once the sun stood striding at high noon, then Father Zeus held out his sacred golden scales: in them he placed two fates of death that lays men low— one for the Trojan horsemen, one for Argives armed in bronze— and gripping the beam mid-haft the Father raised it high and down went Achaea's day of doom, Achaea's fate settling down on the earth that feeds us all as the fate of Troy went lifting toward the sky. And Zeus let loose a huge crash of thunder from Ida, hurling his bolts in a flash against Achaea's armies. The men looked on in horror. White terror seized them all. Neither Idomeneus nor Agamemnon dared stand his ground, nor did the Great and Little Ajax, old campaigners, Nestor alone held out, the noble horseman, Achaea's watch and ward, but not of his own will. One horse was finished, hit by a shaft that fair-haired Helen's lord, magnificent Paris winged at its brow's high peak where the forelock crowns the skull—most fatal spot. It reared in agony, arrow piercing its brain and flung the team in panic, writhing round the brazen point as the old horseman hewed the trace-horse clear, hacked away the straps—sudden strokes of his sword. But on came Hector's team in the rush-and-buck of battle, sweeping their driver Hector on in fighting-fury and then and there old Nestor would have died if Diomedes had not marked him fast— the lord of the war cry gave a harrowing shout, trying to rouse Odysseus: "Where are you running, the royal son of Laertes, cool tactician? Turning your back in battle like some coward! Cutting and running so-take care that no one spears you in the back! Hold firm with me— we'll fight this wild maniac off the old man here!" But long-enduring Odysseus never heard him— down he dashed to the hollow Argive ships. So all on his own Diomedes charged the front, lurched to a halt before old Nestor's team and winged a flight of orders at the horseman: "Old soldier, these young fighters wear you down— your strength goes slack and old age dogs your steps, your driver's worthless, your horses drag their weight. Come, up with you now, climb aboard my chariot! So you can see the breed of Tros's team, their flair for their own terrain as they gallop back and forth, one moment in flight, the next in hot pursuit— I took them both from Aeneas, driving terrors. Your own good team? Our aides will handle them— we'll steer these racers straight at the Trojans now, the great breakers of horses. We'll let Hector see if the spear in my hand is mad for bloodshed too!" And the old charioteer rose to the challenge. Aides caught his team, Sthenelus, loyal Eurymedon, as the two commanders boarded Diomedes' car. Nestor grasped the glistening reins in both fists, lashed the team and they charged straight at Hector charging straight at them as Tydides hurled a spear and missed his man but he picked the driver off, Eniopeus son of proud Thebaeus gripping the reins— he slashed him beside the nipple, stabbed his chest and off the car he pitched, his horses balking, rearing. There on the spot the man's strength and life collapsed and blinding grief for his driver overpowered Hector, stunned for his friend but he left him lying there, dead, and swept on, out for another hardy driver. Nor did his team go long without a master, Hector found one quickly—Iphitus' daring son, Archeptolemus—mounted him up behind his racers, thrust the reins in the fighting driver's hands. Now there would have been havoc, irreversible chaos, the Trojans penned in the walls of Troy like sheep, but the father of men and gods was quick to the mark. A crash of thunder! Zeus let loose a terrific bolt and blazing white at the hoofs of Diomedes' team it split the earth, a blinding smoking flash— molten sulphur exploding into the air, stallions shying, cringing against the car— and the shining reins flew free of Nestor's grip His heart quaking, he cried to Diomedes, "Quick, Tydides, swing these stallions round and fly! Can't you see? Victory comes from Zeus but not for you. He hands the glory to Hector, today at least— tomorrow it's ours, if he wants to give us glory. There's not a man alive who can fight the will of Zeus, even a man of iron—Zeus is so much stronger!" But Diomedes lord of the war cry answered, "Right, old soldier—all you say is true. But here's the grief that cuts me to the quick: one day this Hector will vaunt among his Trojans, 'Diomedes ran for his ships—I drove him back!' So he'll boast, I know— let the great earth gape and take me down that day!" But the noble horseman Nestor shouted back, "Nonsense, steady Tydeus' son—such loose talkl Let Hector call you a coward, scorn your courage-- the Trojan and Dardan troops will never believe him, nor will the wives of the lusty Trojan shieldsmen, never— you flung their lords in the dust, laid them low in their prime!" And with that he swung their racers round, mid-flight, back again to the rout-Trojans and Hector after them, shouting their savage cries and pelting both men now with spears and painful ar ows. Helmet flashing, rangy Hector hurled a resounding yell: "Diomedes— once the Danaan riders prized you first of men with pride of place, choice meats and brimming cups. Now they will disgrace you, a woman after all. Away with you, girl, glittering little puppet! I'll never yield, you'll never mount our towers, never drag our women back to your ships of war— I'll pack you off to the god of darkness first!" Fighting words, and Diomedes was tom two ways-he'd half a mind to turn the team and take him face-to-face . . . Three times Tydides was tempted, heart and soul, three times from the crags of Ida Zeus let loose his thunder, the Master Strategist handing down a sign to the Trojans— victory thunder turning the tide of war their way. And Hector called to his men in a ringing voice, "Trojans! Lycians! Dardan fighters hand-to-hand— now be men, my friends, call up your battle-fury! The Father nods his head in assent, I see, at last he grants me glory, triumph—the Argives, bloody death. Fools, erecting their rampart! Flimsy and futile, not worth a second thought. They'll never hold me back in my onslaught now, with a bound my team will leap that trench they dug. But soon as I reach their hollow ships, torches— don't forget now, one of you bring me lethal firel I'll bum their ships, I'll slaughter all their men, Argive heroes panicked in smoke along their hulls!" And with that threat he called out to his horses, "Golden and Whitefoot, Blaze and Silver Flash! Now repay me for all the loving care Andromache, generous Eetion's daughter, showered on you aplenty. First of the teams she gave you honey-hearted wheat, she even mixed it with wine for you to drink when the spirit moved her—before she'd serve me, though I'm proud to say I am her loving husband. After them, fast, full gallop! So we can seize the shield of Nestor—its fame hits the skies, solid gold, the handgrips and the shield itself— and strip from the stallion-breaking Diomedes' back the burnished armor Hephaestus forged with all his skill. If only we lay our hands on these, I'm filled with hope they'll take to their racing ships this very night!" So he gloried but Queen Hera stirred in outrage, she shook on her throne and Mount Olympus quaked as she cried in the face of the rugged god Poseidon, "You ruthless-the Earth-shaker with all your power— not even a twinge of pity deep inside your heart for all these Argives dying! The same fighters who pile your gifts at Aegae port and Helice, gifts by the shipload, hoards to warm your heart. And you used to plan their victory! If only we, we gods who defend the Argives had the will to hurl the Trojans back and hold off thundering Zeus— there he would sit and smolder, throned in desolate splendor up on Ida." Deeply shaken, the god who rocks the earth replied, "Hera, what wild words! What are you saying? I for one have no desire to battle Zeus, not you and I and the rest of the gods together. The King is far too strong—he'll crush us all." So they harangued each other to a standstill. But as for Achaea's forces, all the ground that the broad trench enclosed from ships to wall was crammed with chariots, teams and men in armor packed into close quarters, yes, and the one man who packed them there, a match for rushing Ares, Hector the son of Priam, now Zeus gave Hector glory. And now he might have gutted the ships with fire, blazing fire—but Queen Hera impelled Agamemnon, out on the run already, to go and rouse his men. He made his way through Achaea's ships and shelters, flaring his great crimson cape with a strong hand and stopped at Odysseus' huge black-bellied hull, moored mid-line so a shout could reach both wings, upshore to Telamonian Ajax' camp or down to Achilles'— trusting so to their arms' power and battle-strength they'd hauled their trim ships up on either flank. Agamemnon's cry went piercing through the army: "Shame! Disgrace! You Argives, you degraded— splendid in battle dress, pure sham! Where have the fighting taunts all gone? That time you vaunted you were the finest force on earth-- all that empty bluster you let fly at Lemnos, gorging yourselves on longhorn cattle meat and drunk to the full on brimming bowls of wine, bragging how each man could stand up to a hundred, no, two hundred Trojan fighters in pitched battle. Now our whole army is no match for one, for Hector-- he'll gut our ships with blazing fire at any moment! Father Zeus, when did you ever strike a mighty king with such mad blindness—then tear away his glory? Not once, I swear, did I pass some handsome shrine of yours, sailing my oar-swept ship on our fatal voyage here, but on each I burned the fat and thighs of oxen, longing to raze Troy's sturdy walls to the roots. So, Father, at least fulfill this prayer for me: let the men escape with their lives if nothing else— don't let these Trojans mow us down in droves!" So he prayed and the Father filled with pity, seeing Atrides weep. The god bent his head that the armies must be saved, not die in blood. That instant he launched an eagle truest of Zeus's signs that fly the skies-a fawn clutched in its talons, sprung of a running doe, but he dropped it free beside the handsome shrine where Achaean soldiers always sacrificed to Zeus whose voice rings clear with omens. Seeing the eagle sent their way from Zeus, they roused their war-lust, flung themselves on the Trojans with a vengeance. There, massed in formation as they were, not a single man could claim he outstripped Diomedes, Tydeus' son lashing his high-strung team across the trench to reach the front and battle hand-to-hand-- the first by far to kill a Trojan captain, Agelaus the son of Phradmon. He'd just turned his chariot round in flight and once he'd swerved Diomedes' spear went punching through his back, gouging his shoulder blade and driving through his chest— he spilled from the chariot, armor clanging against him. Diomedes plowed on and after him came the Atridae, Agamemnon and Menelaus, following in their wake the Great and Little Ajax armed in fury, Idomeneus after them and Idomeneus' good aide, Meriones, a match for the butcher god of war, Eurypylus after them, Euaemon's gallant son, and Teucer came up ninth, tensing his reflex bow and lurking under the wall of giant Ajax' shield. As Ajax raised the rim, the archer would mark a target, shoot through the lines—the man he hit dropped dead on the spot—and quick as a youngster ducking under his mother's skirts he'd duck under Ajax' shield and the gleaming shield would hide him head to toe. Who was the first Trojan the marksman Teucer hit? Orsilochus first, then Ormenus, Ophelestes, Daetor and Chromius, princely Lycophontes, Polyaemon's son Amopaon and Melanippus too— corpse on corpse he dropped to the earth that rears us all. And King Agamemnon, thrilled at the sight of Teucer whipping arrows off his bow, reaping the Trojan ranks, strode up and sang his praises: "Teucer, lovely soldier, Telamon's son, pride of the armies—now you're shooting! You'll bring a ray of hope to your men, your father too. He raised you when you were little, a bastard boy, no matter—Telamon tended you in his own house. Far off as he is, you'll set him up in glory. I tell you this, so help me it's the truth: if Zeus with his storm-shield and Queen Athena ever let me plunder the strong walls of Troy, you are the first, the first after myself— I'll place some gift of honor in your hands, a tripod, or purebred team with their own car or a fine woman to mount and share your bed." And Teucer gave his captain a faultless answer: "Great field marshal, why bother to spur me on? I go all-out as it is. With all the power in me I've never quit, not from the time we rolled them back to Troy. I've stalked with my bow and picked them off in packs. Eight arrows I've let fly, with long sharp barbs, and all stuck in the flesh of soldiers quick to fight— but I still can't bring this mad dog Hector down!" The archer loosed a fresh shaft from the bowstring straight for Hector, his spirit longing to hit him— but he missed and cut Gorgythion down instead, a well-bred son of Priam, a handsome prince, and the arrow pierced his chest, Gorgythion whom Priam's bride from Aesyme bore one day, lovely Castianira lithe as a deathless goddess . . . As a garden poppy, burst into red bloom, bends, drooping its head to one side, weighed down by its full seeds and a sudden spring shower, so Gorgythion's head fell limp over one shoulder, weighed down by his helmet. Quick with another arrow, the archer let fly from his bowstring straight for Hector, his spirit straining to hit him—shot and missed again as Apollo skewed his shaft— but he leveled Archeptolemus, Hector's daring driver charging headlong, caught him square in the chest beside the nipple and off his car he pitched as his horses balked, rearing, pawing the air. There on the spot his strength and life collapsed and blinding grief for the driver overpowered Hector, stunned for his friend but he left him lying there and cried out to his brother Cebriones close by, "Take the reins!" Cebriones rushed to obey— but Hector leapt down from the burnished car, he hit the earth with a yell, seized a rock and went for Teucer, mad to strike the archer just plucking a bitter arrow from his quiver, notching it on the string and drawing back the bow to his right shoulder, when Hector, helmet flashing, caught him where the collarbone bridges neck and chest, the deadliest spot of all. There Hector struck, hurling the jagged rock at Teucer drawing in fury— snapped the string and his hand went numb at the wrist, he dropped to a knee, dazed . . . the bow slipped from his grip. But giant Ajax would never fail his fallen brother— he ran to straddle and hide him with his shield as a brace of comrades shouldered up the fighter: Echius' son Mecisteus helping good Alastor bore him back to the hollow warships, groaning hard. And again the Olympian Father fired up the Trojans ramming Argives back against their own deep trench. Hector far in the lead, bristling in all his force like a hound that harries a wild boar or lion— hot pursuit, snapping quick at his heels, hindquarters and flanks but still on alert for him to wheel and fight—so Hector harried the long-haired Argives, killing the last stragglers, man after lagging man and they, they fled in panic. Back through stakes and across the trench they fled, and hordes were cut down at the Trojans' hands-the rest, only after they reached the shipways, stood fast and shouting out to each other, flung their arms to all the immortals, each man crying out a prayer. But Hector swerved his horses round at the trench's edge, wheeling back and forth, tossing their gorgeous manes, with Hector's eyes glaring bright as a Gorgon's eyes or Ares', man-destroying Ares'. A total rout— and white-armed Hera saw it, and filled with pity the goddess' words went winging toward Athena: "Look, daughter of Zeus whose shield is thunder— don't we care for them any longer? All our Argives dying there in droves! This is our last chance. They're filling out their fates to the last gasp, hacked to pieces under a single man's assault. This maniac, Hector—I cannot bear him any longer. Look at the savage slaughter he has made!" Eyes blazing, Athena answered, "Let him die a thousand deaths!— Hector's life and his battle-frenzy blotted out by the Argives here on Hector's native soil. But Father rages now, that hard black heart, always the old outrage, dashing all my plans! Not a thought for the many times I saved his son Heracles, worked to death by the labors of Eurystheus. How he would whine to the high skies-till Father Zeus would rush me down from the clouds to save his life. If only I'd foreseen all this, I and my cunning— that day Eurystheus sent him down to Death, to the lord who guards the gates, to drag up from the dark world the hound of grisly Death— he would never have fled the steep cascading Styx. But Zeus hates me now. He fulfills the plans of Thetis who cupped his chin in her hand and kissed his knees, begging Zeus to exalt Achilles scourge of cities. But the day will come when Father, well I know, calls me his darling gray-eyed girl again. So now you harness the racing team for us while I go into the halls of storming Zeus and buckle on my gear and arm for combat. Now I'll see if Hector, for all his flashing helmet, leaps for joy when the two of us come blazing forth on the passageways of battle—or one of his Trojans too will glut the dogs and birds with his fat and flesh, brought down in blood against the Argive ships!" The white-armed goddess Hera could not resist. Hera queen of the gods, daughter of giant Cronus launched the work, harnessed the golden-bridled team while Athena, child of Zeus whose shield is thunder, letting fall her supple robe at the Father's threshold— rich brocade, stitched with her own hands' labor— donned the battle-shirt of the lord of lightning, buckled her breastplate geared for wrenching war. Then onto the flaming chariot Pallas set her feet and seized her spear—weighted, heavy, the massive shaft she wields to break the battle lines of heroes the mighty Father's daughter storms against. A crack of the whip— the goddess Hera lashed the team, and all on their own force the gates of heaven thundered open, kept by the Seasons, guards of the vaulting sky and Olympus heights empowered to spread the massing clouds or close them round once more, and straight through the great gates she drove the team. But as Father Zeus caught sight of them from Ida the god broke into a sudden rage and summoned iris to run a message on with a rush of golden wings: "Quick on your way now, Iris, shear the wind! Turn them back, don't let them engage me here. What an indignity for us to clash in arms. I tell you this and I will fulfill it too: I'll maim their racers for them, right beneath their yokes, and those two goddesses, I'll hurl them from their chariot, smash their car, and not once in the course of ten slow wheeling years will they heal the wounds my lightning bolt rips open. So that gray-eyed girl of mine may learn what it means to fight against her Father. But with Hera, though, I am not so outraged, so irate—it's always her way to thwart my will, whatever I command." So he thundered and Iris ran his message, racing with gale force away from the peaks of Ida up to steep Olympus cleft and craggy. There at the outer gates she met them face-to-face and blocked their path, sounding Zeus's orders: "Where are you rushing now? What is this madness blazing in your hearts? Zeus forbids you to fight for Achaea's armies! Here is Father's threat—he will fulfill it too: he'll maim your racers for you, right beneath their yokes, and you two goddesses, he'll hurl you from your chariot, smash your car, and not once in the course of ten slow wheeling years will you heal the wounds his lightning bolt rips open! So you, his gray-eyed girl, may learn what it means to fight against your Father. But with Hera, though, he is not so outraged, so irate-it's always your way to thwart his will, whatever Zeus commands. You, you insolent brazen bitch—you really dare to shake that monstrous spear in Father's face?" And Iris racing the wind went veering past and Hera turned to Pallas, calling off the conflict: "Enough. Daughter of Zeus whose shield is thunder, I cannot let us battle the Father any longer, not for mortal men . . . Men—let one of them die, another live, however their luck may run. Let Zeus decide the fates of the men of Troy and men of Argos both, to his deathless heart's content—that is only right." So she complied and turned their racers back. The Seasons loosed the purebred sleek-maned team, tethered them to their stalls, piled on ambrosia and leaned the chariot up against the polished walls that shimmered in the sun. The goddesses themselves sat down on golden settles, mixing with the immortals, Athena and Hera's hearts within them dashed. At the same time Zeus the Father whipped his team and hurtling chariot straight from Ida to Mount Olympus, soon to reach the sessions of the gods. Quick at Zeus's side the famous lord of earthquakes freed the team, canted the battle-chariot firmly on its base and wrapped it well with a heavy canvas shroud. Thundering Zeus himself assumed his golden throne as the massive range of Olympus shook beneath his feet. Those two alone, Athena and Hera, sat apart from Zeus— not a word would they send his way, not a question. But the Father knew their feelings deep within his heart and mocked them harshly: "Why so crushed, Athena, Hera? Not overly tired, I trust, from all your efforts there in glorious battle, slaughtering Trojans, the men you break with all your deathless rage. But I with my courage, my hands, never conquered-- for all their force not all the gods on Olympus heights could ever turn me back. Ah but the two of you— long ago the trembling shook your glistening limbs before you could glimpse the horrid works of war. I tell you this, and it would have come to pass: once my lightning had blasted you in your chariot, you could never have returned to Mount Olympus where the immortals make their home." So he mocked as Athena and Queen Hera muttered between themselves, huddled together, plotting Troy's destruction. True, Athena held her peace and said nothing . . . smoldering at the Father, seized with wild resentment. But Hera could hold the anger in her breast no longer, suddenly bursting out, "Dread majesty, son of Cronus, what are you saying? We already know your power, far too well . . . who can stand against you? Even so, we pity these Argive spearmen living out their grim fates, dying in blood. Yes, we'll keep clear of the war as you command. We'll simply offer the Argives tactics that may save them-- so they won't all fall beneath your blazing wrath." And Zeus who marshals the thunderheads replied, "Tomorrow at dawn's your chance, my ox-eyed queen. Look down then, if you have the taste for it, Hera, and you will see the towering son of Cronus killing still more hordes, whole armies of Argive soldiers. This powerful Hector will never quit the fighting, not till swift Achilles rises beside the ships that day they battle against the high stems, pinned in the fatal straits and grappling for the body of Patroclus. So runs the doom of Zeus. You and your anger— rage away! I care nothing for that. Not even if you go plunging down to the pit of earth and sea where Cronus and Iapetus make their beds of pain, where not a ray of the Sun can warm their hearts, not a breeze, the depths of Tartarus wall them round. Not if you ventured down as far as the black abyss Itself— I care nothing for you, you and your snarling anger, none in the world a meaner bitch than you." So he erupted but the white-armed goddess Hera answered not a word . . . Now down in the Ocean sank the fiery light of day, drawing the dark night across the grain-giving earth. For the men of Troy the day went down against their will but not the Argives—what a blessing, how they prayed for the nightfall coming on across their lines. But again, still bent on glory, Hector mustered his Trojan cohorts, pulled them back from the ships toward the river rapids, to wide open ground where they found a sector free and clear of corpses. They swung down from their chariots onto earth to hear what Hector dear to Zeus commanded now. He clutched a thrusting-lance eleven forearms long; the bronze tip of the weapon shone before him, ringed with a golden hoop to grip the shaft. Leaning on this, the prince addressed his men: "Hear me, Trojans, Dardans, all our loyal allies! I had hoped by now, once we destroyed them all— all the Achaeans and all their hollow ships— we might turn home to the windy heights of Troy. But night came on too soon. That's what saved them, that alone, they and their ships along the churning surf. Very well then, let us give way to the dark night, set out our supper, unyoke our full-maned teams and pile the fodder down before their hoofs. Drive cattle out of the city, fat sheep too, quickly, bring on rations of honeyed, mellow wine and bread from the halls, and heap the firewood high. Then all night long till the breaking light of day we keep the watch fires blazing, hundreds of fires and the rising glare can leap and hit the skies, so the long-haired Achaeans stand no chance tonight to cut and run on the sea's broad back. Never, not without a struggle, not at their royal ease are they going to board those ships! No, no, let every last man of them lick his wounds— a memento at home—pierced by arrow or spear as he vaults aboard his decks. So the next fool will cringe at the thought of mounting hateful war against our stallion-breaking Trojans. Now let heralds dear to Zeus cry out through the streets of Troy that boys in their prime and old gray-headed men must take up posts on the towers built by the gods, in bivouac round the city. And as for our wives, each in her own hall must set big fires burning. The night watch too, it must be kept unbroken, so no night raiders can slip inside the walls with our armies camped afield. That's our battle-order, my iron-hearted Trojans, just as I command. Let the order I issue now stand firm and clear and the stirring call to arms I sound tomorrow morning, my stallion-breaking Trojans! My hopes are rising now— I pray to Zeus and the great array of deathless gods that we will whip the Achaeans howling out of Troy and drive them off to death, those dogs of war the deadly fates drove here in their black ships! So now, for the night, we guard our own positions, but tomorrow at daybreak, armed to the hilt for battle, waken slashing war against their hollow hulls. I'll soon see if the mighty Diomedes rams me back from the ships and back against our walls or I kill him with bronze and strip his bloody armor! Tomorrow Tydeus' son will learn his own strength-- if he has the spine to stand the onrush of my spear. In the front ranks he'll sprawl, I think, torn open, a rout of his comrades down around their captain just as the sun goes rising into dawn. If only I were as sure of immortality, ageless all my days— and I were prized as they prize Athena and Apollo— as surely as this day will bring the Argives death!" So Hector urged his armies. The Trojans roared assent. The fighters loosed their sweating teams from the yokes, tethered them by the reins, each at his own chariot. They herded' cattle out of the city, fat sheep too, quickly, brought on rations of honeyed, mellow wine and bread from the halls, heaped the firewood high and up from the plain the winds swept the smoke, the sweetness and the savor swirling up the skies. And so their spirits soared as they took positions down the passageways of battle all night long, and the watchfires blazed among them. Hundreds strong, as stars in the night sky glittering round the moon's brilliance blaze in all their glory when the air falls to a sudden, windless calm . . . all the lookout peaks stand out and the jutting cliffs and the steep ravines and down from the high heavens bursts the boundless, bright air and all the stars shine clear and the shepherd's heart exults—so many fires burned between the ships and the Xanthus' whirling rapids set by the men of Troy, bright against their walls. A thousand fires were burning there on the plain and beside each fire sat fifty fighting men poised in the leaping blaze, and champing oats and glistening barley, stationed by their chariots, stallions waited for Dawn to mount her glowing throne. So the Trojans held their watch that night but not the Achaeans— godsent Panic seized them, comrade of bloodcurdling Rout: all their best were struck by grief too much to bear. As crosswinds chop the sea where the fish swarm, the North Wind and the West Wind blasting out of Thrace in sudden, lightning attack, wave on blacker wave, cresting, heaving a tangled mass of seaweed out along the surf— so the Achaeans' hearts were torn inside their chests. Distraught with the rising anguish, Atreus' son went ranging back and forth, commanding heralds to sound out loud and clear and call the men to muster, each by name, but no loud outcry now. The king himself pitched in with the lead heralds, summoning troops. They grouped on the meeting grounds, morale broken. Lord marshal Agamemnon rose up in their midst, streaming tears like a dark spring running down some. desolate rock face, its shaded currents flowing. So, with a deep groan, the king addressed his armies: "Friends . . . lords of the Argives, all my captains! Cronus' son has entangled me in madness, blinding ruin— Zeus is a harsh, cruel god. He vowed to me long ago, he bowed his head that I should never embark for home till I had brought the walls of Ilium crashing down. But now, I see, he only plotted brutal treachery: now he commands me back to Argos in disgrace, whole regiments of my men destroyed in battle. So it must please his overweening heart, who knows? Father Zeus has lopped the crowns of a thousand cities, true, and Zeus will lop still more—his power is too great. So come, follow my orders. Obey me, all you Argives. Cut and run! Sail home to the fatherland we love! We'll never take the broad streets of Troy." Silence held them all, struck dumb by his orders. A long while they said nothing, spirits dashed. Finally Diomedes lord of the war cry broke forth: "Atrides—I will be first to oppose you in your folly, here in assembly, King, where it's the custom. Spare me your anger. My courage- mine was the first you mocked among the Argives, branding me a coward, a poor soldier. Yes, well, they know all about that, the Argives young and old. But you—the son of Cronus with Cronus' twisting ways gave you gifts by halves: with that royal scepter the Father gave you honor beyond all other men alive but he never gave you courage, the greatest power of all. Desperate man! So certain, are you, the sons of Achaea are cowards, poor soldiers, just because you say so? Desert—if your spirit drives you to sail home, then sail away, my King! The sea-lanes are clear, there are your ships of war, crowded down the surf, those that followed you from Mycenae, your own proud armada. But the rest of the long-haired Achaeans will hold out, right here, until we've plundered Troy. And they, if they go running home to the land they love, then the two of us, I and Sthenelus here will fight our way to the fixed doom of Troy. Never forget—we all sailed here with god." And all the Achaeans shouted their assent, stirred by the stallion-breaking Diomedes' challenge. But Nestor the old driver rose and spoke at once: "Few can match your power in battle, Diomedes, and in council you excel all men your age. So no one could make light of your proposals, not the whole army—who could contradict you? But you don't press on and reach a useful end. How young you are . . . why, you could be my son, my youngest-born at that, though you urge. our kings with cool clear sense: what you've said is right. But it's my turn now, Diomedes. I think I can claim to have some years on you. So I must speak up and drive the matter home. And no one will heap contempt on what I say, not even mighty Agamemnon. Lost to the clan, lost to the hearth, lost to the old ways, that one who lusts for all the horrors of war with his own people. But now, I say, let us give way to the dark night, set out the evening meal. Sentries take up posts, squads fronting the trench we dug outside the rampart. That's the command I give the younger fighters. Then, Atrides, lead the way—you are the greatest king— spread out a feast for all your senior chiefs. That is your duty, a service that becomes you. Your shelters overflow with the wine Achaean ships bring in from Thrace, daily, down the sea's broad back. Grand hospitality is yours, you rule so many men. Come, gather us all and we will heed that man who gives the best advice. That's what they need, I tell you—all the Achaeans-good sound advice, now our enemies, camping hard against the ships, kindle their watchfires round us by the thousands. What soldier could warm to that? Tonight's the night that rips our ranks to shreds or pulls us through." The troops hung on his words and took his orders. Out they rushed, the sentries in armor, forming under the son of Nestor, captain Thrasymedes, under Ascalaphus, Ialmenus, sons of Ares, under Meriones, Aphareus and Deipyrus, under the son of Creon, trusty Lycomedes. Seven chiefs of the guard, a hundred under each, fighters marching, grasping long spears in their hands, took up new positions between the trench and rampart. There they lit their fires, each man made his meal. Meanwhile marshal Agamemnon led his commanders, a file of senior chiefs, toward his own lodge and set before them a feast to please their hearts. They reached out for the good things that lay at hand but when they had put aside desire for food and drink the old man began to weave his counsel among them: Nestor was first to speak—from the early days his plans and tactics always seemed the best. With good will to the chiefs he rose and spoke, "Great marshal Atrides, lord of men Agamemnon . . . with you I will end, my King, with you I will begin, since you hold sway over many warriors, vast armies, and Zeus has placed in your hands the royal scepter and time-honored laws, so you will advise them well. So you above all must speak your mind, and listen, and carry out the next man's counsel too, whenever his spirit leads him on to speak for the public good. Credit will go to you for whatever he proposes. Now I will tell you what seems best to me. No one will offer a better plan than this . . . the plan I still retain, and I've been forming, well, for a good long while now, from the very day that you, my illustrious King, infuriated Achilles— you went and took from his tents the girl Briseis, and not with any applause from us, far from it: I for one, I urged you against it, strenuously. But you, you gave way to your overbearing anger, disgraced a great man the gods themselves esteem— you seized his gift of honor and keep her still. But even so, late as it is, let us contrive to set all this to rights, to bring him round with gifts of friendship and warm, winning words." And Agamemnon the lord of men consented quickly: "That's no lie, old man—a full account you give of all my acts of madness. Mad, blind I was! Not even I would deny it. Why look, that man is worth an entire army, the fighter Zeus holds dear with all his heart— how he exalts him now and mauls Achaea's forces! But since I was blinded, lost in my own inhuman rage, now, at last, I am bent on setting things to rights: I'll give a priceless ransom paid for friendship. Here, before you all, I'll name in full the splendid gifts I offer. Seven tripods never touched by fire, ten bars of gold, twenty burnished cauldrons, a dozen massive stallions, racers who earned me trophies with their speed. He is no poor man who owns what they have won, not strapped for goods with all that lovely gold— what trophies those high-strung horses carried off for me! Seven women I'll give him, flawless, skilled in crafts, women of Lesbos—the ones I chose, my privilege, that day he captured the Lesbos citadel himself: they outclassed the tribes of women in their beauty. These I will give, and along with them will go the one I took away at first, Briseus' daughter, and I will swear a solemn, binding oath in the bargain: I never mounted her bed, never once made love with her— the natural thing for mankind, men and women joined. Now all these gifts will be handed him at once. But if, later, the gods allow us to plunder the great city of Priam, let him enter in when we share the spoils, load the holds of his ship with gold and bronze—as much as his heart desires— and choose for his pleasure twenty Trojan women second only to Argive Helen in their glory. And then, if we can journey home to Achaean Argos, pride of the breasting earth, he'll be my son-by-marriage! I will even honor him on a par with my Orestes, full-grown by now, reared in the lap of luxury. Three daughters are mine in my well-built halls— Chrysothemis and Laodice and Iphianassa— and he may lead away whichever one he likes, with no bride-price asked, home to Peleus' house. And I will add a dowry, yes, a magnificent treasure the likes of which no man has ever offered with his daughter! Seven citadels I will give him, filled with people, Cardamyle, Enope, and the grassy slopes of Hire, Pherae the sacrosanct, Anthea deep in meadows, rolling Aepea and Pedasus green with vineyards. All face the sea at the far edge of sandy Pylos and the men who live within them, rich in sheep-flocks, rich in shambling cattle, will honor him like a god with hoards of gifts and beneath his scepter's sway live out his laws in sleek and shining peace. All this— I would extend to him if he will end his anger. Let him submit to me! Only the god of death is so relentless, Death submits to no one so mortals hate him most of all the gods. Let him bow down to me! I am the greater king, I am the elder-born, I claim—the greater man." Nestor the noble charioteer embraced his offer: "Generous marshal Atrides, lord of men Agamemnon! No one could underrate these gifts of yours, not now, the treasure trove you offer Prince Achilles. Come—we'll send a detail of picked men. They'll go to Achilles' tent with all good speed. Quick, whomever my eye will light on in review, the mission's theirs. And old Phoenix first-- Zeus loves the man, so let him lead the way. Then giant Ajax and tactful royal Odysseus. Heralds? Odius and Eurybates, you escort them. Water for their hands! A reverent silence now . . . a prayer to Zeus. Perhaps he'll show us mercy." The brisk commands he issued pleased them all. Heralds brought the water at once and rinsed their hands, and the young men brimmed the mixing bowls with wine and tipping first drops for the god in every cup they poured full rounds for all. Libations finished, each envoy having drunk to his heart's content, the party moved out from Atrides' shelters. Nestor the old driver gave them marching orders— a sharp glance at each, Odysseus most of all: "Try hard now, bring him round-invincible Achilles!" So Ajax and Odysseus made their way at once where the battle lines of breakers crash and drag, praying hard to the god who moves and shakes the earth that they might bring the proud heart of Achilles round with speed and ease. Reaching the Myrmidon shelters and their ships, they found him there, delighting his heart now, plucking strong and clear on the fine lyre— beautifully carved, its silver bridge set firm— he won from the spoils when he razed Eetion's city. Achilles was lifting his spirits with it now, singing the famous deeds of fighting heroes . . . Across from him Patroclus sat alone, in silence, waiting for Aeacus' son to finish with his song. And on they came, with good Odysseus in the lead, and the envoys stood before him. Achilles, startled, sprang to his feet, the lyre still in his hands, leaving the seat where he had sat in peace. And seeing the men, Patroclus rose up too as the famous runner called and waved them on: "Welcome! Look, dear friends have come our way— I must be sorely needed now—my dearest friends in all the Achaean armies, even in my anger." So Prince Achilles hailed and led them in, sat them down on settles with purple carpets and quickly told Patroclus standing by, "Come, a bigger winebowl, son of Menoetius, set it here. Mix stronger wine. A cup for the hands of each guest— here beneath my roof are the men I love the most." He paused. Patroclus obeyed his great friend, who put down a heavy chopping block in the firelight and across it laid a sheep's chine, a fat goat's and the long back cut of a full-grown pig, marbled with lard. Automedon held the meats while lordly Achilles carved them into quarters, cut them well into pieces, pierced them with spits and Patroclus raked the hearth, a man like a god making the fire blaze. Once it had burned down and the flames died away, he scattered the coals and stretching the spitted meats across the embers, raised them onto supports and sprinkled clean pure salt. As soon as the roasts were done and spread on platters, Patroclus brought the bread, set it out on the board in ample wicker baskets. Achilles served the meat. Then face-to-face with his noble guest Odysseus he took his seat along the farther wall, he told his friend to sacrifice to the gods and Patroclus threw the first cuts in the fire. They reached out for the good things that lay at hand and when they had put aside desire for food and drink, Ajax nodded to Phoenix. Odysseus caught the signal, filled his cup and lifted it toward Achilles, opening with this toast: "Your health, Achilles! We have no lack of a handsome feast, I see that, either in Agamemnon's tents, the son of Atreus, or here and now, in yours. We can all banquet here to our heart's content. But it's not the flowing feast that is on our minds, now—no, a stark disaster, too much to bear, Achilles bred by the gods, that is what we are staring in the face and we are afraid. All hangs in the balance now: whether we save our benched ships or they're destroyed, unless, of course, you put your fighting power in harness. They have pitched camp right at our ships and rampart, those brazen Trojans, they and their far-famed allies, thousands of fires blaze throughout their armies ... Nothing can stop them now-that's their boast-- they'll hurl themselves against our blackened hulls. And the son of Cronus sends them signs on the right, Zeus's firebolts flashing. And headlong Hector, delirious with his strength, rages uncontrollably, trusting to Zeus—no fear of man or god, nothing-- a powerful rabid frenzy has him in its grip! Hector prays for the sacred Dawn to break at once, he threatens to lop the high horns of our stems and gut our ships with fire, and all our comrades pinned against the hulls, panicked by thick smoke, he'll rout and kill in blood! A nightmare—I fear it, with all my heart— I fear the gods will carry out his threats and then it will be our fate to die in Troy, far from the stallion-land of Argos . . . Up with you— now, late as it is, if you want to pull our Argives, our hard-hit armies, clear of the Trojan onslaught. Fail us now? What a grief it will be to you through all the years to come. No remedy, no way to cure the damage once it's done. Come, while there's still time, think hard: how can you fight off the Argives' fatal day? Oh old friend, surely your father Peleus urged you, that day he sent you out of Phthia to Agamemnon, 'My son, victory is what Athena and Hera will give, if they so choose. But you, you hold in check that proud, fiery spirit of yours inside your chest! Friendship is much better. Vicious quarrels are deadly— put an end to them, at once. Your Achaean comrades, young and old, will exalt you all the more.' That was your aged father's parting advice. It must have slipped your mind. But now at last, stop, Achilles-let your heart-devouring anger go! The king will hand you gifts to match his insults if only you'll relent and end your anger . . . So come then, listen, as I count out the gifts, the troves in his tents that Agamemnon vows to give you. Seven tripods never touched by fire, ten bars of gold, twenty burnished cauldrons, a dozen massive stallions, racers who earned him trophies with their speed. He is no poor man who owns what they have won, not strapped for goods with all that lovely gold— what trophies those high-strung horses carried off for him! Seven women he'll give you, flawless, skilled in crafts, women of Lesbos—the ones he chose, his privilege, that day you captured the Lesbos citadel yourself: they outclassed the tribes of women in their beauty. These he will give, and along with them will go the one he took away at first, Brjseus' daughter, and he will swear a solemn, binding oath in the bargain: he never mounted her bed, never once made love with her ... the natural thing, my lord, men and women joined. Now all these gifts will be handed you at once. But if, later, the gods allow us to plunder the great city of Priam, you shall enter in when we share the spoils, load the holds of your ship with gold and bronze—as much as your heart desires— and choose for your pleasure twenty Trojan women second only to Argive Helen in their glory. And then, if we can journey home to Achaean Argos, pride of the breasting earth, you'll be his son-by-marriage . . . He will even honor you on a par with his Orestes, full-grown by now, reared in the lap of luxury. Three daughters are his in his well-built halls, Chrysothemis and Laodice and Iphianassa— and you may lead away whichever one you like, with no bride-price asked, home to Peleus' house. And he will add a dowry, yes, a magnificent treasure the likes of which no man has ever offered with his daughter . . . Seven citadels he will give you, filled with people, Cardamyle, Enope, and the grassy slopes of Hire, Pherae the sacrosanct, Anthea deep in meadows, rolling Aepea and Pedasus green with vineyards. All face the sea at the far edge of sandy Pylos and the men who live within them, rich in sheep-flocks, rich in shambling cattle, will honor you like a god with hoards of gifts and beneath your scepter's sway live out your laws in sleek and shining peace. All this . . . he would extend to you if you will end your anger. But if you hate the son of Atreus all the more, him and his troves of gifts, at least take pity on all our united forces mauled in battle here-- they will honor you, honor you like a god. Think of the glory you will gather in their eyes! Now you can kill Hector—seized with murderous frenzy, certain there's not a single fighter his equal, no Achaean brought to Troy in the ships— now, for once, you can meet the man head-on!" The famous runner Achilles rose to his challenge: "Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, great tactician . .. I must say what I have to say straight out, must tell you how I feel and how all this will end— so you won't crowd around me, one after another, coaxing like a murmuring clutch of doves. I hate that man like the very Gates of Death who says one thing but hides another in his heart. I will say it outright. That seems best to me. Will Agamemnon win me over? Not for all the world, nor will all the rest of Achaea's armies. No, what lasting thanks in the long run for warring with our enemies, on and on, no end? One and the same lot for the man who hangs back and the man who battles hard. The same honor waits for the coward and the brave. They both go down to Death, the fighter who shirks, the one who works to exhaustion. And what's laid up for me, what pittance? Nothing— and after suffering hardships, year in, year out, staking my life on the mortal risks of war. Like a mother bird hurrying morsels back to her unfledged young-whatever she can catch— but it's all starvation wages for herself. So for me. Many a sleepless night I've bivouacked in harness, day after bloody day I've hacked my passage through, fighting other soldiers to win their wives as prizes. Twelve cities of men I've stormed and sacked from shipboard, eleven I claim by land, on the fertile earth of Troy. And from all I dragged off piles of splendid plunder, hauled it away and always gave the lot to Agamemnon, that son of Atreus—always skulking behind the lines, safe in his fast ships—and he would take it all, he'd parcel out some scraps but keep the lion's share. Some he'd hand to the lords and kings—prizes of honor— and they, they hold them still. From me alone, Achilles of all Achaeans, he seizes, he keeps the bride I love ... Well let him bed her now— enjoy her to the hilt! Why must we battle Trojans, men of Argos? Why did he muster an army, lead us here, that son of Atreus? Why, why in the world if not for Helen with her loose and lustrous hair? Are they the only men alive who love their wives, those sons of Atreus? Never! Any decent man, a man with sense, loves his own, cares for his own as deeply as I, I loved that woman with all my heart, though I won her like a trophy with my spear ... But now that he's tom my honor. from my hands, robbed me, lied to me—don't let him try me now. I know him too well—he'll never win me over! No, Odysseus, let him rack his brains with you and the other captains how to fight the raging fire off the ships. Look-- what a mighty piece of work he's done without me! Why, he's erected a rampart, driven a trench around it, broad, enormous, and planted stakes to guard it. No use! He still can't block the power of man-killing Hector! No, though as long as I fought on Achaea's lines Hector had little lust to charge beyond his walls, never ventured beyond the Scaean Gates and oak tree. There he stood up to me alone one day— and barely escaped my onslaught. Ah but now, since I have no desire to battle glorious Hector, tomorrow at daybreak, once I have sacrificed to Zeus and all the gods and loaded up my holds and launched out on the breakers—watch, my friend, if you'll take the time and care to see me off, and you will see my squadrons sail at dawn, fanning out on the Hellespont that swarms with fish, my crews manning the oarlocks, rowing out with a will, and if the famed god of the earthquake grants us safe passage, the third day out we raise the dark rich soil of Phthia. There lies my wealth, hoards of it, all I left behind when I sailed to Troy on this, this insane voyage-- and still more hoards from here: gold, ruddy bronze, women sashed and lovely, and gleaming gray iron, and I will haul it home, all I won as plunder. All but my prize of honor . . . he who gave that prize has snatched it back again— what outrage! That high and mighty King Agamemnon, that son of Atreus! Go back and tell him all, all I say-out in the open too—so other Achaeans can wheel on him in anger if he still hopes— who knows?—to deceive some other comrade. Shameless, inveterate—armored in shamelessness! Dog that he is, he'd never dare to look me straight in the eyes again. No, I'll never set heads together with that man— no planning in common, no taking common action. He cheated me, did me damage, wrong! But never again, he'll never rob me blind with his twisting words again! Once is enough for him. Die and be damned for all I care! Zeus who rules the world has ripped his wits away. His gifts, I loathe his gifts . . . I wouldn't give you a splinter for that man! Not if he gave me ten times as much, twenty times over, all he possesses now, and all that could pour in from the world's end— not all the wealth that's freighted into Orchomenos, even into Thebes, Egyptian Thebes where the houses overflow with the greatest troves of treasure, Thebes with the hundred gates and through each gate battalions, two hundred fighters surge to war with teams and chariots— no, not if his gifts outnumbered all the grains of sand and dust in the earth—no, not even then could Agamemnon bring my fighting spirit round until he pays me back, pays full measure for all his heartbreaking outrage! His daughter . . . I will marry no daughter of Agamemnon. Not if she rivaled Aphrodite in all her golden glory, not if she matched the crafts of clear-eyed Athena, not even then would I make her my wife! No, let her father pitch on some other Argive— one who can please him, a greater king than I. If the gods pull me through and I reach home alive, Peleus needs no help to fetch a bride for me himself. Plenty of Argive women wait in Hellas and in Phthia, daughters of lords who rule their citadels in power. Whomever I want I'll make my cherished wife—at home. Time and again my fiery spirit drove me to win a wife, a fine partner to please my heart, to enjoy with her the treasures my old father Peleus piled high. I say no wealth is worth my life! Not all they claim was stored in the depths of Troy, that city built on riches, in the old days of peace before the sons of Achaea came— not all the gold held fast in the Archer's rocky vaults, in Phoebus Apollo's house on Pytho's sheer cliffs! Cattle and fat sheep can all be had for the raiding, tripods all for the trading, and tawny-headed stallions. But a man's life breath cannot come back again— no raiders in force, no trading brings it back, once it slips through a man's clenched teeth. Mother tells me, the immortal goddess Thetis with her glistening feet, that two fates bear me on to the day of death. If I hold out here and I lay siege to Troy, my journey home is gone, but my glory never dies. If I voyage back to the fatherland I love, my pride, my glory dies . . . true, but the life that's left me will be long, the stroke of death will not come on me quickly. One thing more. To the rest I'd pass on this advice: sail home now! You will never set your eyes on the day of doom that topples looming Troy. Thundering Zeus has spread his hands above her— her armies have taken heart! So you go back to the great men of Achaea. You report my message— since this is the privilege of senior chiefs— let them work out a better plan of action, use their imaginations now to save the ships and Achaea's armies pressed to their hollow hulls. This maneuver will never work for them, this scheme they hatched for the moment as I raged on and on. But Phoenix can stay and rest the night with us, so he can voyage home, home in the ships with me to the fatherland we love. Tomorrow at dawn. But only if Phoenix wishes. I will never force the man to go." He stopped. A stunned silence seized them all, struck dumb— Achilles' ringing denials overwhelmed them so. At last Phoenix the old charioteer spoke out, he burst into tears, terrified for Achaea's fleet: "Sail home? Is that what you're turning over in your mind, my glorious one, Achilles? Have you no heart at all to fight the gutting fire from the fast trim ships? The spirit inside you overpowered by anger! How could I be severed from you, dear boy, left behind on the beachhead here—alone? The old horseman Peleus had me escort you, that day he sent you out of Phthia to Agamemnon, a youngster still untrained for the great leveler, war, still green at debate where men can make their mark. So he dispatched me, to teach you all these things, to make you a man of words and a man of action too. Cut off from you with a charge like that, dear boy? I have no heart to be left behind, not even if Zeus himself would swear to scrape away the scurf of age and make me young again . . . As fresh as I was that time I first set out from Hellas where the women are a wonder, fleeing a blood feud with my father, Amyntor, Ormenus' son. How furious father was with me, over his mistress with her dark, glistening hair. How he would dote on her and spurn his wedded wife, my own mother! And time and again she begged me, hugging my knees, to bed my father's mistress down and kill the young girl's taste for an old man. Mother—I did your bidding, did my work . . . But father, suspecting at once, cursed me roundly, he screamed out to the cruel Furies—'Never, never let me bounce on my knees a son of his, sprung of his loins!'—and the gods drove home that curse, mighty Zeus of the Underworld and grim Persephone. So I, I took it into my head to lay him low with sharp bronze! But a god checked my anger, he warned me of what the whole realm would say, the loose talk of the people, rough slurs of men— they must not call me a father-killer, our Achaeans! Then nothing could keep me there, my blood so fired up. No more strolling about the halls with father raging. But there was a crowd of kin and cousins round me, holding me in the house, begging me to stay . . . they butchered plenty of fat sheep, banquet fare, and shambling crook-homed cattle, droves of pigs, succulent, rich with fat—they singed the bristles, splaying the porkers out across Hephaestus' fire, then wine from the old man's jars, all we could drink. Nine nights they passed the hours, hovering over me, keeping the watch by rounds. The fires never died, one ablaze in the colonnade of the walled court, one in the porch outside my bedroom doors. But then, when the tenth night came on me, black as pitch, I burst the doors of the chamber bolted tight and out I rushed, I leapt the walls at a bound, giving the slip to guards and women servants. And away I fled through the whole expanse of Hellas and gaining the good dark soil of Phthia, mother of flocks, I reached the king, and Peleus gave me a royal welcome. Peleus loved me as a father loves a son, I tell you, his only child, the heir to his boundless wealth, he made me a rich man, he gave me throngs of subjects, I ruled the Dolopes, settling down on Phthia's west frontier. And I made you what you are—strong as the gods, Achilles— I loved you from the heart. You'd never go with another to banquet on the town or feast in your own halls. Never, until I'd sat you down on my knees and cut you the first bits of meat, remember? You'd eat your fill, I'd hold the cup to your lips and all too often you soaked the shirt on my chest, spitting up some wine, a baby's way . . . a misery. Oh I had my share of troubles for you, Achilles, did my share of labor. Brooding, never forgetting the gods would bring no son of mine to birth, not from my own loins. So you, Achilles— great godlike Achilles—I made you my son, I tried, so someday you might fight disaster off my back. But now, Achilles, beat down your mounting fury! It's wrong to have such an iron, ruthless heart. Even the gods themselves can bend and change, and theirs is the greater power, honor, strength. Even the gods, I say, with incense, soothing vows, with full cups poured and the deep smoky savor men can bring them round, begging for pardon when one oversteps the mark, does something wrong. We do have Prayers, you know, Prayers for forgiveness, daughters of mighty Zeus . . . and they limp and halt, they're all wrinkled, drawn, they squint to the side, can't look you in the eyes, and always bent on duty, trudging after Ruin, maddening, blinding Ruin. But Ruin is strong and swift— She outstrips them all by far, stealing a march, leaping over the whole wide earth to bring mankind to grief. And the Prayers trail after, trying to heal the wounds. And then, if a man reveres these daughters of Zeus as they draw near him, they will help him greatly and listen to his appeals. But if one denies them, turns them away, stiff-necked and harsh—off they go to the son of Cronus, Zeus, and pray that Ruin will strike the man down, crazed and blinded until he's paid the price. Relent, Achilles—you too! See that honor attend these good daughters of Zeus, honor that sways the minds of others, even heroes. If Agamemnon were not holding out such gifts, with talk of more to come, that son of Atreus, if the warlord kept on blustering in his anger, why, I'd be the last to tell you, 'Cast your rage to the winds! Defend your friends!'—despite their desperate straits. But now, look, he gives you a trove of treasures right away, and vows there are more to follow. He sends the bravest captains to implore you, leaders picked from the whole Achaean army, comrades-in-arms that you love most yourself. Don't dismiss their appeal, their expedition here— though no one could blame your anger, not before. So it was in the old days too. So we've heard in the famous deeds of fighting men, of heroes, when seething anger would overcome the great ones. Still you could bring them round with gifts and winning words. There's an old tale I remember, an ancient exploit, nothing recent, but this is how it went .: . We are all friends here—let me tell it now. The Curetes were fighting the combat-hard Aetolians, armies ringing Calydon, slaughtering each other, Aetolians defending their city's handsome walls and Curetes primed to lay them waste in battle. It all began when Artemis throned in gold loosed a disaster on them, incensed that Oeneus offered her no first fruits, his orchard's crowning glory. The rest of the gods had feasted full on oxen, true, but the Huntress alone, almighty Zeus's daughter— Oeneus gave her nothing. It slipped his mind or he failed to care, but what a fatal error! How she fumed, Zeus's child who showers arrows, she loosed a bristling wild boar, his tusks gleaming, crashing his savage, monstrous way through Oeneus' orchard, ripping up whole trunks from the earth to pitch them headlong, rows of them, roots and all, appleblossoms and all! But the son of Oeneus, Meleager, cut him down— mustering hunters out of a dozen cities, packs of hounds as well. No slim band of men could ever finish him off, that rippling killer, he stacked so many men atop the tear-soaked pyre. But over his body the goddess raised a terrific din, a war for the prize, the huge beast's head and shaggy hide— Curetes locked to the death with brave Aetolians. Now, so long as the battle-hungry Meleager fought, it was deadly going for the Curetes. No hope of holding their ground outside their own city walls, despite superior numbers. But then, when the wrath came sweeping over the man, the same anger that swells the chests of others, for all their care and self-control-- then, heart enraged at his own dear mother Althaea, Meleager kept to his bed beside his wedded wife, Cleopatra . . . that great beauty. Remember her? The daughter of trim-heeled Marpessa, Euenus' child, and her husband Idas, strongest man of the men who once walked the earth—he even braved Apollo, he drew his bow at the Archer, all for Marpessa the girl with lovely ankles. There in the halls her father and mother always called Cleopatra Halcyon, after the seabird's name . . . grieving once for her own fate her mother had raised the halcyon's thin, painful cry, wailing that lord Apollo the distant deadly Archer had whisked her far from Idas. Meleager's Cleopatra— she was the one he lay beside those days, brooding over his heartbreaking anger. He was enraged by the curses of his mother, volleys of curses she called down from the gods. So racked with grief for her brother he had killed she kept pounding fists on the earth that feeds us all, kept crying out to the god of death and grim Persephone, flung herself on the ground, tears streaking her robes and she screamed out, 'Kill Meleager, kill my son!' And out of the world of darkness a Fury heard her cries, stalking the night with a Fury's brutal heart, and suddenly— thunder breaking around the gates, the roar of enemies; towers battered under assault. And Aetolia's elders begged Meleager, sent high priests of the gods, pleading, 'Come out now! defend your people now!'— and they vowed a princely gift. Wherever the richest land of green Calydon lay, there they urged him to choose a grand estate, full fifty acres, half of it turned to vineyards, half to open plowland, and carve it from the plain. And over and over the old horseman Oeneus begged him, he took a stand at the vaulted chamber's threshold, shaking the bolted doors, begging his own son! Over and over his brothers and noble mother implored him—he refused them all the more— and troops of comrades, devoted, dearest friends. Not even they could bring his fighting spirit round until, at last, rocks were raining down on the chamber, Curetes about to mount the towers and torch the great city! And then, finally, Meleager's bride, beautiful Cleopatra begged him, streaming tears, recounting all the griefs that fall to people whose city's seized and plundered— the men slaughtered, citadel burned to rubble, enemies dragging the children, raping the sashed and lovely women. How his spirit leapt when he heard those horrors— and buckling his gleaming armor round his body, out he rushed to war. And so he saved them all from the fatal day, he gave way to his own feelings, but too late. No longer would they make good the gifts, those troves of gifts to warm his heart, and even so he beat off that disaster . . . empty-handed. But you, you wipe such thoughts from your mind. Don't let your spirit turn you down that path, dear boy. Harder to save the warships 'once they're up in flames. Now—while the gifts still wait—go out and fight! Go—the Achaeans all will honor you like a god! But enter this man-killing war without the gifts— your fame will flag, no longer the same honor, even though you hurl the Trojans home!" But the swift runner Achilles answered firmly, "Phoenix, old father, bred and loved by the gods, what do I need with honor such as that? I say my honor lies in the great decree of Zeus. That gift will hold me here by the beaked ships as long as the life breath remains inside my chest and my springing knees will lift me. Another thing— take it to heart, I urge you. Stop confusing my fixed resolve with this, this weeping and wailing just to serve his pleasure, Atreus' mighty son. It degrades you to curry favor with that man, and I will hate you for it, I who love you. It does you proud to stand by me, my friend, to attack the man who attacks me— be king on a par with me, take half my honors! These men will carry their message back, but you, you stay here and spend the night in a soft bed. Then, tomorrow at first light, we will decide whether we sail home or hold out here." With that, he gave Patroclus a sharp glance, a quiet nod to pile the bedding deep for Phoenix now, a sign to the rest to think of leaving quickly. Giant Ajax rose to his feet, the son of Telamon, tall as a god, turned and broke his silence: "Ready, Odysseus? Royal son of Laertes, great tactician—come, home we go now. There's no achieving our mission here, I see, not with this approach. Best to return at once, give the Achaeans a full report, defeating as it is. They must be sitting there, waiting for us now. Achilles— he's made his own proud spirit so wild in his chest, so savage, not a thought for his comrades' love— we honored him past all others by the ships. Hard, ruthless man . . . Why, any man will accept the blood-price paid for a brother murdered, a child done to death. And the murderer lives on in his own country— the man has paid enough, and the injured kinsman curbs his pride, his smoldering, vengeful spirit, once he takes the price. You—the gods have planted a cruel, relentless fury in your chest! All for a girl, just one, and here we offer you seven—outstanding beauties— that, and a treasure trove besides. Achilles, put some human kindness in your heart. Show respect for your own house. Here we are, under your roof, sent from the whole Achaean force! Past all other men, all other Achaean comrades, we long to be your closest, dearest friends." And the swift runner Achilles answered warmly, "Ajax, royal son of Telamon, captain of armies, all well said, after my own heart, 'or mostly so. But my heart still heaves with rage whenever I call to mind that arrogance of his— how he mortified me, right in front of the Argives— that son of Atreus treating me like some vagabond, like some outcast stripped of all my rights! You go back to him and declare my message: I will not think of arming for bloody war again, not till the son of wise King Priam, dazzling Hector batters all the way to the Myrmidon ships and shelters, slaughtering Argives, gutting the hulls with fire. But round my own black ship and camp this Hector blazing for battle will be stopped, I trust— stopped dead in his tracks!" So he finished. Then each man, lifting his own two-handled cup, poured it out to the gods, and back they went along the ships, Odysseus in the lead. Patroclus told his friends and serving-women to pile a deep warm bed for Phoenix, quickly. They obeyed and spread the bed as he ordered, with fleeces, woolen throws and soft linen sheets. There the old man lay, awaiting shining Dawn. And deep in his well-built lodge Achilles slept with the woman he brought from Lesbos, Phorbas' daughter, Diomede in all her beauty sleeping by his side. And over across from him Patroclus slept with the sashed and lovely Iphis by his side, whom Prince Achilles gave him the day he took the heights of Scyros, Enyeus' rocky stronghold. But once the envoys reached Atrides' shelters, comrades leapt to their feet, welcomed them back and clustering round them, lifted golden cups. One after another pressed them with questions, King Agamemnon most urgent of all: "Come— tell me, famous Odysseus, Achaea's pride and glory— will he fight the fire off the ships? Or does he refuse, does rage still grip his proud, mighty spirit?" And the steady, long-enduring Odysseus replied, "Great marshal Atrides, lord of men Agamemnon, that man has no intention of quenching his rage. He's still bursting with anger, more than ever— he spurns you, spurns all your gifts. Work out your own defense, he says, you and your captains save the Argive armies and the ships. Himself? Achilles threatens, tomorrow at first light, to haul his well-benched warships out to sea. And what's more, he advises all the rest, 'Sail home now. You will never set your eyes on the day of doom that topples looming Troy. Thundering Zeus has spread his hands above her . . . her armies have taken heart.' That's his answer. And here are men to confirm it, fellow envoys. Ajax and two heralds, both clear-headed men. But old Phoenix passes the night in camp as Achilles bids him, so he can voyage home, home in the ships with him to the fatherland they love. Tomorrow at dawn. But only if Phoenix wishes. He will never force the man to go." So he reported. Silence held them all, struck dumb by his story, Odysseus' words still ringing in their ears. A long while they said nothing, spirits dashed. Finally Diomedes lord of the war cry broke forth: "Great marshal Atrides, lord of men Agamemnon— if only you'd never begged the dauntless son of Peleus, holding out to Achilles trove on trove of gifts! He's a proud man at the best of times, and now you've only plunged him deeper in his pride. I say have done with the man— whether he sails for home or stays on here. He'll fight again—in his own good time-whenever the courage in him flares and a god fires his blood. So come, follow my orders. And all of us unite. Go to sleep now, full to your heart's content with food and wine, a soldier's strength and nerve. Then when the Dawn's red fingers shine in all their glory, quickly deploy your chariots and battalions, Agamemnon, out in front of the ships-you spur them on and you yourself, you fight in the front ranks!" And Achaea's kings all shouted their assent, stirred by the stallion-breaking Diomedes' challenge. Pouring cups to the gods, each warlord sought his shelter. There they spent the night and took the gift of sleep. So by the ships the other lords of Achaea's armies slept all night long, overcome by gentle sleep . . . But not the great field marshal Agamemnon-- the sweet embrace of sleep could not hold him: his mind kept churning, seething. Like Zeus's bolts when the lord of bright-haired Hera flashes lightning, threatening to loose torrential rain or pelting hail or snow when a blizzard drifts on fields—or driving on, somewhere on earth, the giant jaws of rending war— so thick-and-fast the groans came from Atrides, wrenching his chest, heaving up from his heart and rocked his very spirit to the core. Now as he scanned across the Trojan plain Agamemnon marveled in horror at those fires, a thousand fires blazing against the walls of Troy, and the shrill of pipes and flutes and low roar of men. And now as he glanced back at Achaea's troops and ships he tore out his hair by the roots, he looked to Zeus on high, groaning from the depths of his proud, embattled heart. But soon this recourse struck his mind as best: he would go and approach the son of Neleus first and see if Nestor could work out something with him, some foolproof plan that just might ward disaster off the Achaean forces. He rose up quickly and over his chest he pulled a battle-shirt, under his smooth feet he fastened supple sandals, round him slung the glossy hide of a big tawny lion, swinging down to his heels, and grasped a spear. And the same anguish shook Menelaus too— no sleep could settle over his eyes, not now. He feared his men might meet the worst at last, comrades who crossed a waste of seas for him to raise Troy and mount their fierce assault. First he covered his broad back with leopard skin, a fine spotted hide, then lifting a round helmet of good sturdy bronze, he fitted it to his head, he took a spear in his grip and off he strode to rouse his brother, king of all the Argives, the armies that prized him in his power like a god. And Menelaus found him alongside his ship's stem, strapping his handsome gear around his shoulders. Agamemnon warmed with pleasure as he came up but Menelaus lord of the war cry ventured first, "Why arming now, my brother? To spur a volunteer to spy on Trojan lines? Not a man in sight will take that mission on, I fear, and go against our enemies, scout them out alone in the bracing godsent night— it will take a daring man to do the job." King Agamemnon answered crisply; "Tactics, my noble Menelaus. That's what we need now, you and I both, and cunning tactics too. Something to shield and save our men and ships since Zeus's heart has turned—his mighty heart is set on Hector's offerings more than ours. I've never seen or heard tell of a single man wreaking so much havoc in one day as Hector, Zeus's favorite, wreaks against our troops, and all on his own-no son of god or goddess. He's made a slaughter, I tell you. Pain for Achaeans, enough to last us down the years to come . . . what blows he's dealt our men! Go now, call Ajax, Idomeneus, quickly, make a run for it down along the ships. I'll go after Nestor, wake and rouse him, see if the good man wants to join the guard, that strong contingent, and give them orders. He's the one they'll obey. His own son commands the sentry-line, he and Idomeneus' aide Meriones. They above all—we put those men in charge." The lord of the war cry nodded, "Yes, fine, but what orders for me? Do I stay with them, waiting for you to come? Or follow you on the run, once I've given the captains your command?" The marshal made things clearer: "You stay there— so we don't miss one another rushing back and forth in the endless maze of pathways up and down the camp. But shout wherever you go, tell them to stay awake. And call each man by his name and father's line, show them all respect. Not too proud now. We are the ones who ought to do the work. On our backs, from the day that we were born, it seems that Zeus has piled his pack of hardships." With his order clear, he sent his brother off while he went after Nestor, the old commander. He found him beside his black ship and shelter, stretched on a fleecy bed, his blazoned gear at hand, his shield and two long spears and burnished helmet. His war-belt lay beside him, gleaming in all its fire. The old man cinched it on whenever he'd harness up, marching his men to war where fighters die— Nestor gave no ground to withering old age. He propped himself on an elbow, craned his head and probed sharply, whispering through the dark, "Who goes there? Stalking along the ships, alone through camp in the very dead of night when other mortals try to catch some sleep. Tracking a stray mule or a lost companion? Speak! Don't steal on me in silence—what do you want?" The lord of men Agamemnon reassured him: "Nestor, son of Neleus, glory of Achaea, don't you recognize Agamemnon? The one man, past all others, Zeus has plunged in troubles, year in, year out, for as long as the life breath fills my lungs and the spring in my knees will lift me.. I roam this way since sleep won't close my eyes-- war's my worry, the agonies of our Achaeans. How I fear for our comrades, fear the worst! My mind is torn, I'm harried back and forth, the heart inside me pounding through my chest and the sturdy legs beneath me giving way. But if you want action now— sleeping is just as hard for you, it seems— come, let's go down to the sentry-line and see if numb with exhaustion, lack of sleep, they've nodded off, all duty wiped from their minds, the watch dissolved. Our blood enemies camp hard by. How do we know they're not about to attack us in the night?" And the old charioteer warmed to his challenge: "Great marshal Atrides, lord of men Agamemnon— Hector and Hector's high hopes? Not a chance. The plans of Zeus will never bring them off, those dreams of glory inspiring Hector now. Oh I think he'll have his troubles to shoulder, plenty of them too, if Achilles ever turns away from the heartbreaking anger deep inside him. Follow you? Surely. Let's wake others also, Diomedes famed for his spear, Odysseus, quick Little Ajax and Phyleus' brave son. And if only one would go and call the rest, giant Ajax strong as a god and King Idomeneus— they're hardly close, their ships last on the line. But I will blame Menelaus, loved as he is and honored, even if you will wheel on me in anger—I must, I can't hide it now. How that fellow sleeps! Turning over the work to you alone. Now is the time for him to work, to hunt the leading captains and beg them all for help. Desperate straits-we can't hold out much longer." The lord of men replied, "You're right, old soldier. I'd even urge you to fault him any other day. So often he hangs back, with no heart for the work, not that he shrinks from action, skittish or off guard— it's just that he looks to me, waiting for me to make the first move. This time, though, he woke before me, came and roused me first and I sent him off to call the men you're after. So let's move out, overtake the rest at the gates, with the sentries where I ordered them to group." And Nestor the noble charioteer assented gladly: "True, when the man leaps in the breach that way no one can blame or disobey him, no Achaean, not when he spurs the troops and gives commands." With that he slipped his tunic over his chest, under his smooth feet he fastened supple sandals, pinned with a brooch his crimson cape around him, flowing in double folds and topped with thick fleece, and gripping a tough spear tipped with a brazen point, he strode along the ships of the Argives armed in bronze. And reaching Odysseus first, a mastermind like Zeus, the old driver roused him from sleep, shouting out, "Wake up!" The cry went ringing through his ears and out of his tent he came, shouting in return, "Why, why prowling along the ships and camp, you alone in the bracing godsent night— what's the crisis now? What trouble's come?" And Nestor the noble charioteer replied, "Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, great tactician, no time for anger now— such misery has overcome our Argives. Follow us, come, so we can wake the next man, some captain fit to map our strategy here, whether we break and run or stand and fight." Backing into his tent, the great tactician slung his wrought shield on his back and joined the party striding toward the son of Tydeus, Diomedes. They found him with all his gear outside his shelter, cohorts sleeping round him, shields beneath their heads, spears stuck straight in the ground on butt-end spikes and the bronze points flashing into the distance like forked lightning flung by Father Zeus. But the veteran fighter lay there fast asleep, the cured hide of a field ox spread beneath him, a lustrous blanket stretched beneath his head . . . The old charioteer moved in and woke him roughly, dug a heel in his ribs, chiding him to his face, "Up with you, Diomedes! What, sleep all night? Haven't you heard? Trojans hold the high ground, over the beachhead there, camped against the ships— only a narrow strip to keep off sudden death." So he prodded and Diomedes woke from sleep with a quick start and burst of winging words: "A hard man you are, old soldier—hard. You never give up the good fight, do you? Where are the younger troopers now we need them? Why don't they go wake each king in turn-- padding softly up and down through camp? You, old man, you'd overpower us all!" And Nestor the noble driver answered warmly, "Right you are, my friend, straight to the point. Sons I have, and they're hardy, handsome boys, and comrades too, men aplenty-one of the lot could light out now and summon up the kings. But now a crisis has overwhelmed our armies., Our fate, I tell you, stands on a razor's edge: life or death for Achaea, gruesome death at that. Up with you! Wake quick Little Ajax, Meges too. You're so much younger—come, pity an old man." And round his back Diomedes slung the hide of a big tawny lion, swinging down to his heels, he grasped 'a spear and the fighter strode away and roused those men to leave their beds and march. And now as they filed among the mustered guard they found the chief sentries far from sleep— on the alert, all stationed set with weapons. Like sheepdogs keeping watch on flocks in folds, a nervous, bristling watch when the dogs get wind of a wild beast rampaging down through mountain timber, crashing toward the pens, and the cries break as he charges, a din of men and dogs, and their sleep is broken, gone— and so the welcome sleep was routed from their eyes, guardsmen keeping the long hard watch that night. Always turning toward the plain, tense to catch some sign of the Trojans launching an attack. The old chariot-driver warmed to the sight and cheered them on with urgings flying fast: "Keep it up, my boys, that's the way to watch! Not one of you submit to the grip of sleep— you'd give great joy to the men who'd take our lives." With that the driver clambered through the trench. They took the old captain's lead, the Argive kings all called to the muster now. And flanking them Meriones came in haste with Nestor's handsome son— the kings had summoned both to share their counsel. Crossing out over the deep trench they grouped on open ground, where they chanced to find a sector free and clear of corpses, in fact the very place where Hector in all his power had veered and turned away from cutting Argives down when night closed in. There they settled, conferring among themselves till the noble horseman opened with his plan: "My friends, isn't there one man among us here, so sure of himself, his soldier's nerve and pluck, he'd infiltrate these overreaching Trojans? Perhaps he'd seize a straggler among the foe or catch some rumor floating along their lines. What plans are they mapping, what maneuvers next? Are they bent on holding tight by the ships, exposed?— or heading home to Troy, now they've trounced our armies? If a man could gather that, then make it back unharmed, why, what glory he'd gain across the whole wide earth in the eyes of every man—and what a gift he'd win! All the lords who command the ships of battle, each and every one will give him a black ewe suckling a young lamb-no prize of honor like it. They'll ask that man to every feast and revel." So Nestor proposed. All ranks held their peace but Diomedes lord of the war cry spoke up briskly: "Nestor, the mission stirs my fighting blood. I'll slip right into enemy lines at once— these Trojans, camped at our flank. If another comrade would escort me, though, there'd be more comfort in it, confidence too. When two work side-by-side, one or the other spots the opening first if a kill's at hand. When one looks out for himself, alert but alone, his reach is shorter—his sly moves miss the mark." At that a crowd volunteered to go with Diomedes. The two Aeantes, old campaigners, volunteered, Meriones volunteered and Nestor's son leapt up and Menelaus the famous spearman volunteered and battle-hardened Odysseus too, to foray into the Trojan units camped for the night— Odysseus' blood was always up for exploit. But King Agamemnon interceded quickly, "Diomedes, soldier after my own heart, pick your comrade now, whomever you want, the best of the volunteers-how many long to go! But no false respect. Don't pass over the better man and pick the worse. Don't bow to a soldier's rank, an eye to his birth—even if he's more kingly." He suddenly feared for red-haired Menelaus but Diomedes strong with the war cry answered, "Is that an order? Pick my own comrade? Then how could I 7,-.,s up royal- Odysseus here? His heart's so game, his fighting edge so keen, the best of us all in every combat mission— Athena loves the man. With him at my side we'd go through fire and make it back alive— no one excels the mastermind of battle." But much-enduring Odysseus cut him short: "Not too long on the praise-don't fault me either. You're talking to Argive men who know my record. Let's move out. The night is well on its way and daybreak's near. The stars go wheeling by, the full of the dark is gone—two watches down but the third's still ours for action." On that note both men harnessed up in the grim gear of war . . . Thrasymedes staunch in combat handed Tydeus' son a two-edged sword—he'd left his own at the ship— a shield too, and over his head he set a helmet, bull's-hide, bare of ridge and crest, a skullcap, so it's called, and made to protect the heads of tough young-blooded fighters. Meriones gave Odysseus bow, quiver and sword and over his head he set a helmet made of leather. Inside it was crisscrossed taut with many thongs, outside the gleaming teeth of a white-tusked boar ran round and round in rows stitched neat and tight— a master craftsman's work, the cap in its center padded soft with felt. The Wolf Himself Autolycus lifted that splendid headgear out of Eleon once, he stole it from Ormenus' son Amyntor years ago, breaching his sturdy palace walls one night then passed it on to Amphidamas, Cythera-born, Scandia-bound. Amphidamas gave it to Molus, a guest-gift once that Molus gave Meriones his son to wear in battle. And now it encased Odysseus' head, snug around his brows. And so, both harnessed up in the grim gear of war, the two men moved out, leaving behind them all the captains clustered on the spot. . Athena winged a heron close to their path and veering right. Neither man could see it, scanning the dark night, they only heard its cry. Glad for the lucky sign, Odysseus prayed to Pallas, "Hear me, daughter of Zeus whose shield is thunder! Standing by me always, in every combat mission— no maneuver of mine slips by you—now, again, give me your best support, Athena, comrade! Grant our return in glory back to the warships once we've done some feat that brings the Trojans pain!" Next Diomedes lord of the war cry prayed aloud, "Hear me too, daughter of Zeus, tireless goddess! Be with me now, just as you went with father, veteran Tydeus, into Thebes that day he ran ahead of the Argives with his message. He left his armored men along the Asopus banks and carried a peaceful word to Theban cohorts crowded in their halls. But turning back he bent to some grand and grisly work with you, Goddess, and you stood by him then, a steadfast ally. So come, stand by me now, protect me now! I will make you a sacrifice, a yearling heifer broad in the brow, unbroken, never yoked by men. I'll offer it up to you—I'll sheathe its horns in gold!" Their prayers rose and Pallas Athena heard them. Once they'd appealed to Zeus's mighty daughter, into the black night they went like two lions stalking through the carnage and the corpses, through piles of armor and black pools of blood. But no sleep for the headstrong Trojans either. Hector would not permit it. He summoned all his chiefs to a council of war, all Trojan lords and captains. Mustering them he launched his own crafty plan: "Who will undertake a mission and bring it off for a princely gift? A prize to match the exploit! I'll give him a chariot, two horses with strong necks, the best of the breeds beside Achaea's fast ships. Whoever will dare—what glory he can win— a night patrol by the ships to learn at once if the fleet's still guarded as before or now, battered down at our hands, huddling together, they plan a quick escape, their morale too low to mount the watch tonight—bone-weary from battle." So Hector proposed. All ranks held their peace. But there was a man among the troops, one Dolon, a son of the sacred Trojan herald Eumedes. He was rich in bronze, rich in bars of gold, no feast for the eyes but lightning on his feet and an only son in the midst of five sisters. This one volunteered among the Trojans: "Hector, the mission stirs my fighting blood— I'll reconnoiter the ships and gather all I can. Come, raise that scepter and swear you'll give me the battle-team and the burnished brazen car that carry great Achilles—I will be your spy. And no mean scout, I'll never let you down. I'll infiltrate their entire army, I will, all the way till I reach the ship of Agamemnon! That's where the captains must be mapping tactics now, whether they'll break and run or stand and fight." How he bragged and Hector, grasping his scepter, swore a binding oath: "Now Zeus my witness, thundering lord of Hera-no other Trojan fighter will ride behind that team, none but you, I swear— they will be your glory all your life to come!" So Hector vowed—with an oath he swore in vain but it spurred the man to action. Dolon leapt to it, he quickly slung a reflex bow on his back, over it threw the pelt of a gray wolf and set on his head a cap of weasel skin and taking a sharp spear, moved out from camp, heading toward the fleet—but he was never to come back from the enemy's beaked ships, bringing Hector news. Putting the mass of horse and men behind him Dolon picked up speed, hot for action now, but keen as a god Odysseus saw him coming and alerted Diomedes: "Who is this? A man heading out of the Trojan camp! Why? I can't be sure—to spy on our ships or loot the fallen, one of the fighters' corpses? Let him get past us first, into the clear a bit, then rush him and overtake him double-quick! If he outruns us, crowd him against the ships, cut him off from his lines, harry him with your spear and never stop—so he can't bolt back to Troy." No more words. Swerving off the trail they both lay facedown with the corpses now as Dolon sped by at a dead run, the fool. Soon as he got a furlong's lead ahead, the plowing-range of a good team of mules— faster than draft oxen dragging a bolted plow through deep fallow ground—the two raced after and Dolon, hearing their tread, froze stock-still, his heart leaping—here were friends, yes, fellow Trojans coming to turn him back, yes, Hector had just called off the mission! But soon as they were a spear-cast off or less he saw them—enemies— quick as a flash he sprang, fleeing for dear life— they sprang in pursuit as a pair of rip-tooth hounds bred for the hunt and flushing fawn or hare through a woody glen keep closing for the kill, nonstop and the prey goes screaming on ahead— so Odysseus raider of cities and Diomedes cut him off from his own lines, coursing him, closing nonstop with the Trojan about to break in on the line of sentries, racing fast for the ships-- when Athena poured fresh strength in Tydeus' son so no Achaean could beat him out for the glory of hitting Dolon first, Diomedes come in second. Rushing him with his spear in a sudden surge Tydides shouted, "Stop or I'll run you through! You'll never escape my spear—headlong death— I swear I'll send it hurling from my fist!" He flung his shaft, missing the man on purpose-- over his right shoulder the sharp spearpoint winged and stabbed the earth. Dead in his tracks he stopped, terrified, stammering, teeth chattering in his mouth, bled white with fear as the two men overtook him and panting hard, yanked and pinned his arms. He burst into tears, pleading, "Take me alive! I'll ransom myself! Treasures cram our house, bronze and gold and plenty of well-wrought iron-- father would give you anything, gladly, priceless ransom— if only he learns I'm still alive in Argive ships!" Odysseus quick with tactics answered, "Courage. Death is your last worry. Put your mind at rest. Come, tell me the truth now, point by point. Why prowling among the ships, cut off from camp, alone in the dead of night when other men are sleeping? To loot the fallen, one of the fighters' corpses? Or did Hector send you out to spy on our ships, reconnoiter them stem to stem? Or did your own itch for glory spur you on?" Dolon answered, his legs shaking under him, "Hector—he duped me so—so many mad, blind hopes! He swore he'd give me the great Achilles' stallions, purebred racers, his burnished bronze chariot tool He told me to go through the rushing dark night, to patrol the enemy lines and learn at once if the fleet's still guarded as before or now, battered down at our hands, huddling together, you plan a quick escape, your morale too low to mount the watch tonight—bone-weary from battle." Breaking into a smile the cool tactician laughed, "By god, what heroic gifts you set your heart on— the great Achilles' team! They're hard for mortal men to curb or drive, for all but Achilles—his mother is immortal. Now out with it, point by point. Hector— where did you leave the captain when you came? Where's his war-gear lying? where's his chariot? How are the other Trojans posted—guards, sleepers? What plans are they mapping, what maneuvers next? Are they bent on holding tight by the ships, exposed?— or heading home to Troy, now they've trounced our armies?" And Dolon son of the herald blurted out, "Yes, yes, I'll tell you everything, down to the last detail! Hector's holding council with all his chiefs, mapping plans on old King Ilus' barrow, clear of the crowds at camp. Guards, my lord? Nothing. No one's picked to defend the army. Only our native Trojans hold their posts— many as those with hearth fires back in Troy— our men have no choice, shouting out to each other, 'Stay awake! keep watch!' But our far-flung friends, they're fast asleep, they leave the watch to us— their wives and children are hardly camped nearby." But the shrewd tactician kept on pressing: "Be precise. Where are they sleeping? Mixed in with the Trojans? Separate quarters? Tell me. I must know it all." And Dolon son of the herald kept on blurting, "Everything—anything—whatever will satisfy you! To seaward, Carians, Paeonian men with bent bows, Leleges and Cauconians, crack Pelasgians—inland, toward Thymbra, camp the Lycians, swaggering Mysians, fighting Phrygian horsemen, Maeonian chariot-drivers— but why interrogate me down to the last platoon? You really want to raid some enemy units? There are the Thracians, look, just arrived, exposed on the flank, apart from all the rest and right in their midst Eioneus' son, King Rhesus. His are the best horses I ever saw, the biggest, whiter than snow, and speed to match the wind! His chariot's finished off with gold and silver, the armor he's brought in with him, gold too, tremendous equipment—what a marvelous sight. No gear for a mortal man to wear, I'd say, it's fit for the deathless gods! There. Now will you take me to your ships or leave me here—bound and gagged right here?— till you can make your raid and test my story, see if I've told the truth or I've been lying." But rugged Diomedes gave him a grim look: "Escape? Take my advice and wipe it from your mind, good as your message is—you're in my hands now. What if we set you free or you should slip away? Back you'll slink to our fast ships tomorrow, playing the spy again or fighting face-to-face. But if I snuff your life out in my hands, you'll never annoy our Argive lines again." With that, just as Dolon reached up for his chin to cling with a frantic hand and beg for life, Diomedes struck him square across the neck— a flashing hack of the sword—both tendons snapped and the shrieking head went tumbling in the dust. They tore the weasel-cap from the head, stripped the wolf pelt, the reflex bow and long tough spear and swinging the trophies high to Pallas queen of plunder, exultant royal Odysseus shouted out this prayer: "Here, Goddess, rejoice in these, they're yours! You are the first of all the gods we'll call! Now guide us again, Athena, guide us against that Thracian camp and horses!" So Odysseus prayed and hoisting the spoils over his head, heaved them onto a tamarisk bush nearby and against it heaped a good clear landmark, clumping together reeds and fresh tamarisk boughs they'd never miss as they ran back through the rushing dark night. On they stalked through armor and black pools of blood and suddenly reached their goal, the Thracian outpost. The troops were sleeping, weary from pitching camp, their weapons piled beside them on the ground, three neat rows of the burnished well-kept arms and beside each man his pair of battle-horses. Right in the midst lay Rhesus dead asleep, his white racers beside him, strapped by thongs to his chariot's outer rail. Spotting him first Odysseus quickly pointed him out to Diomedes: "Look, here's our man, here are his horses. The ones marked out by the rascal we just killed. On with it now—show us your strength, full force. Don't just stand there, useless with your weapons. Loose those horses—or you go kill the men and leave the team to me!" Athena, eyes blazing, breathed fury in Diomedes and he went whirling into the slaughter now, hacking left and right and hideous groans broke from the dying Thracians slashed by the sword-the ground ran red with blood. As a lion springs on flocks unguarded, shepherd gone, pouncing on goats or sheep and claw-mad for the kill, so Tydeus' son went tearing into that Thracian camp until he'd butchered twelve. Each man he'd stand above and chop with the sword, the cool tactician Odysseus grappled from behind, grabbing the fighter's heels, dragging him out of the way with one thought in mind: that team with their flowing manes must get through fast, not quake at heart and balk, trampling over the dead, those purebred horses still not used to corpses. But now the son of Tydeus came upon the king, the thirteenth man, and ripped away his life, his sweet life as he lay there breathing hard. A nightmare hovered above his head that night— Diomedes himself! sped by Athena's battle-plan— while staunch Odysseus loosed the stamping horses, hitched them together tight with their own reins and drove them through the nick, lashing them with his bow: he forgot to snatch the shining whip that lay in the well-wrought car. He whistled shrill, his signal to rugged Diomedes pausing, deep in thought . . . what was the worst, most brazen thing he could do? Seize the car where the handsome armor lay and pull it out by the pole or prize it up, bodily, haul it off— or tear the life from still more Thracian troops? His mind swarming with all this, Pallas Athena swept to his side and cautioned Diomedes, "Back— think only of getting back, great son of Tydeus! Back to the ships, quick, or you'll run for your life! Some other god—who knows?—may wake the Trojans." The goddess' voice—he knew it, mounted at once as Odysseus whacked the stallions smartly with his bow and they made a run for Achaea's rapid ships. But Apollo lord of the silver bow kept watch. No blind man's watch, no, Apollo saw Athena take Tydides in hand, and raging against her plunged into the main mass of Trojan fighters to rouse a Thracian captain called Hippocoon, a loyal kinsman of Rhesus. He woke with a jolt and seeing empty ground where the fast team had stood, men gasping out their lives, retching in all that carnage, he wailed out, sobbing, crying his dear companion's name and piercing wails broke as the Trojans swirled in panic— a desperate rout of them rushing up to the bloodbath ,there stood staring down at the grisly work the marauders did before they made their dash for the beaked ships. Reaching the place where they'd killed Hector's spy, Odysseus dear to Zeus reined in the headlong team and leaping down to the ground Tydides heaved the bloody spoils into his comrade's arms. He mounted again and flogged the horses hard and on they flew to the ships, holding nothing back— that's where their spirits drove them on to go. Nestor, the first to hear their thunder, shouted, "Friends—lords of the Argives, all our captains, right or wrong, what can I say? My heart tells me, my ears ring with the din of drumming hoofs .. . If only Odysseus and rugged Diomedes were driving racers off the Trojan lines, here, here and fast! I'm cold with fear—what if they've met the worst, our ranking Argives killed in a Trojan charge?" Before he could say the last, the two raced in, leapt to the ground and comrades hugged them warmly, with handclasps all around and words of welcome. Nestor the noble horseman led with questions: "Tell me, Odysseus, Achaea's pride and glory, famous Odysseus, how did you get these horses? How—stealing behind the Trojans' main lines or meeting up with a god who gave them to you? What terrific sheen-silver afire like sunbeams! Day after day I've gone against the Trojans, never hanging back by the ships, I swear, old warrior that I am— But I've never seen such horses, never dreamed . . . I'd say an immortal came your way and gave you these. Zeus who marshals the storm cloud loves you both, Zeus's daughter too with the shield of thunder. Athena's eyes are shining on you both!" The cool tactician set the record straight: "No, no, Nestor—Achaea's greatest glory— any god, if he really set his mind to it, could give us an even finer pair than this. Easily. The gods are so much stronger. Now these horses you ask about, old soldier, they're newcomers, just arrived from Thrace. Their master? Brave Diomedes killed him off, twelve of his cohorts too, all men of rank. And a thirteenth man besides, a scout we took— prowling along the ships, spying on our positions— Hector and all his princely Trojans sent him out." And across the trench he drove the purebred team with a rough exultant laugh as comrades cheered, crowding in his wake. And once they reached Tydides' sturdy lodge they tethered the horses there with well-cut reins, hitching them by the trough where Diomedes' stallions pawed the ground, champing their sweet barley. Then away in his ship's stem Odysseus stowed the bloody gear of Dolon, in pledge of the gift they'd sworn to give Athena. The men themselves, wading into the sea, washed off the crusted sweat from shins and necks and thighs. And once the surf had scoured the thick caked sweat from their limbs and the two fighters cooled, their hearts revived and into the polished tubs they climbed and bathed. And rinsing off, their skin sleek with an olive oil rub, they sat down to their meal and dipping up their cups from an overflowing bowl, they poured them forth— honeyed, mellow wine to the great goddess Athena. Now Dawn rose up from bed by her lordly mate Tithonus, bringing light to immortal gods and mortal men. But Zeus flung Strife on Achaea's fast ships, the brutal goddess flaring his storm-shield, his monstrous sign of war in both her fists. She stood on Odysseus' huge black-bellied hull, moored mid-line so a shout could reach both wings, upshore to Telamonian Ajax' camp or down to Achilles'— trusting so to their arms' power and battle-strength they'd hauled their trim ships up on either flank. There Strife took her stand, raising her high-pitched cry, great and terrible, lashing the fighting-fury in each Achaean's heart—no stopping them now, mad for war and struggle. Now, suddenly, battle thrilled them more than the journey home, than sailing hollow ships to their dear native land. Agamemnon cried out too, calling men to arms and harnessed up in gleaming bronze himself. First he wrapped his legs with well-made greaves, fastened behind the heels with silver ankle-clasps, and next he strapped the breastplate round his chest that Cinyras gave him once, a guest-gift long ago. The rousing rumor of war had carried far as Cyprus— how the Achaean ships were launching war on Troy— so he gave the king that gear to please his spirit. Magnificent! Ten bands of blue enamel spanned it, spaced by twelve of gold and twenty of beaten tin and dark blue serpents writhed toward the throat, three each side, shimmering bright as rainbows arched on the clouds by Cronus' son, a sign to mortal men. Then over his shoulder Agamemnon slung his sword, golden studs at the hilt, the blade burnished bright and the scabbard sheathed in silver swung on golden straps, and he grasped a well-wrought shield to encase his body, forged for rushing forays—beautiful, blazoned work. Circling the center, ten strong rings of bronze with twenty disks of glittering tin set in, at the heart a boss of bulging blue steel and there like a crown the Gorgon's grim mask— the burning eyes, the stark, transfixing horror— and round her strode the shapes of Rout and Fear. The shield-belt glinted silver and rippling on it ran a dark blue serpent, two heads coiling round a third, reared from a single neck and twisting left and right. Then over his broad brow Agamemnon set his helmet fronted with four knobs and forked with twin horns and the horsehair crest atop it tossing, bristling terror. And last he picked up two tough spears, tipped in bronze, honed sharp, and the glare flashed off their brazen points and pierced the high skies—and awestruck at the sight Athena and Hera loosed a crack of thunder, exalting the great king of Mycenae rich in gold. At once each captain shouted out commands to his driver: "Rein the team by the trench, good battle-order now!" While the men themselves, armed for full assault, leapt down and swarmed to the trench's edge on foot and a long undying roar went up in the early dawn. Well ahead of the war-cars they reached the brink, closed ranks as drivers backed them yards behind. But Zeus drove a swirl of panic deep in their lines and down from the vaulting skies released a shower raining blood, for Zeus was bent on hurling down to the House of Death a rout of sturdy fighters. Trojans—the other side on the plain's high ground— formed around tall Hector, staunch Polydamas, Aeneas loved by the Trojans like a god, and Antenor's sons, Polybus, Prince Agenor and Acamas still unwed, three men in their prime like gods who never die. Hector bore his round shield in the forefront, blazing out like the Dog Star through the clouds, all withering fire, then plunging back in the cloud-rack massed and dark— so Hector ranged on, now flaring along the front, now shouting his orders back toward the rear, all of him armed in bronze aflash like lightning flung by Father Zeus with his battle-shield of thunder. And the men like gangs of reapers slashing down the reaping-rows and coming closer, closer across the field of a warlord rich in wheat or barley— swaths by the armfuls falling thick-and-fast— so Achaeans and Trojans closed and slashed, lunging into each other and neither side now had a thought of flight that would have meant disaster. No, the pressure of combat locked them head-to-head, lunging like wolves, and Strife with wild groans exulted to see them, glaring down at the melee, Strife alone of immortals hovering over fighters. The other gods kept clear, at their royal ease, reclining off in the halls where the roofs of each were built for the ages high on rugged ridged Olympus. And all were blaming Zeus with his storming dark clouds because the Father decreed to hand the Trojans glory. But the Father paid no heed to them. Retiring peaks apart from the other gods, he sat aloof, glorying in his power, gazing out over . the city walls of Troy and the warships of Achaea, the flash of bronze, fighters killing, fighters killed . . . As long as morning rose and the blessed day grew stronger, the weapons hurtled side-to-side and men kept falling. But just when the woodsman makes his morning meal, deep in a mountain forest, arm-weary from chopping the big heavy trunks and his heart has had enough and sudden longing for tempting food overtakes the man and makes his senses whirl just at the height of morning the Argives smashed battalions, their courage breaking through and they shouted ranks of cohorts on along the lines. And right in the midst sprang Agamemnon first and killed a fighter, Bienor, veteran captain, then his aide Oileus lashing on their team. Down from the car he'd leapt, squaring off, charging in full fury, full face, straight into Agamemnon's spearhead ramming sharp— the rim of the bronze helmet could not hold it, clean through heavy metal and bone the point burst and the brains splattered all inside the casque. He battered Oileus down despite the Trojan's rage and the lord of fighters left them lying there, both dead and their chests gleamed like bronze as he stripped them bare. Then on he went for Isus and Antiphus, killed and stripped the two sons of Priam, one a bastard, one royal blood and both riding a single car, the bastard driving, the famous Antiphus standing poised beside him . . . Achilles had caught them once on the spurs of Ida, bound them with willow ropes as they watched their flocks and set them free for ransom. But now it was Agamemnon lord of the far-flung kingdoms catching up with Isus— he stabbed his chest with a spear above the nipple, Antiphus he hacked with a sword across the ear and hurled him from his chariot, rushing fast to rip the splendid armor off their bodies. He knew them both, he'd seen them once by the ships when the swift Achilles dragged them in from Ida. Think how a lion, mauling the soft weak young of a running deer, clamped in his massive jaws, cracks their backbones with a snap—he's stormed in, invading the lair to tear their tender hearts out and the mother doe, even if she's close by, what can she do to save her fawns? She's helpless— terrible trembling racks her body too—and suddenly off she bounds through the glades and the thick woods, drenched in sweat, leaping clear of the big cat's pounce., So not a single Trojan could save those two from death, they fled themselves before the Argive charge. But next Agamemnon killed Pisander and combat-hard Hippolochus, two sons of Antimachus, that cunning, politic man whom Paris bribed with gold and sumptuous gifts, so he was the first to fight the return of Helen to red-haired Menelaus. Now powerful Agamemnon caught his two sons riding the same chariot, both struggling to curb their high-strung team— the reins slipped their grasp, both horses panicked as Agamemnon ramped up in their faces like a lion— both fighters shouting from their chariot, pleading, "Take us alive, Atrides, take a ransom worth our lives! Vast treasures are piled up in Antimachus' house, bronze and gold and plenty of well-wrought iron— father would give you anything, gladly, priceless ransom if only he learns we're still alive in Argive ships!" So they cried to the king, cries for mercy, but only heard a merciless voice in answer: "Cunning Antimachus! So you're that man's sons? Once in the Trojan council he ordered Menelaus, there on an embassy joined by King Odysseus, murdered right on the spot—no safe-conduct back to the land of Argos. You're his sons? Now pay for your father's outrage, blood for blood!" And he pitched Pisander off the chariot onto earth and plunged a spear in his chest—the man crashed on his back as Hippolochus leapt away, but him he killed on the ground, slashing off his arms with a sword, lopping off his head and he sent him rolling through the carnage like a log. He left them there for dead and just at the point where most battalions scattered Agamemnon charged, the rest of his troops in armor quick behind him now, infantry killing infantry fleeing headlong, hard-pressed, drivers killing drivers—under the onrush dust in whirlwinds driven up from the plain, hoofs of stallions rumbling thunder, bronze flashing, immense slaughter and always King Agamemnon whirling to kill, crying his Argives on, breakneck on. Like devouring fire roaring down onto dry dead timber, squalls hurling it on, careening left and right and brush ripped up by the roots goes tumbling under crushed by the blasting fire rampaging on— so under Atrides' onslaught Trojans dropped in flight, stampedes of massive stallions dragged their empty chariots clattering down the passageways of battle, stallions yearning to feel their masters' hands at the reins but there they lay, sprawled across the field, craved far more by the vultures than by wives. But Zeus drew Hector out of range of the weapons, out of the dust storm, out of the mounting kills, the blood and rout of war as Atrides followed hard, shouting his Argives on, furious, never stopping. The Trojans streaked in flight past Ilus' barrow, ancient son of Dardanus, past the mid-field mark of the plain and past the wild fig and struggling to reach Troy and always in hot pursuit and shrieking, Agamemnon splattered with gore, his hands, invincible hands. But once they reached the Scaean Gates and the great oak, there the two sides halted, waiting each other's charge. Yet stragglers still stampeded down the plain like cattle driven wild by a lion lunging in pitch darkness down on the whole herd but to one alone a sudden death comes flashing— first he snaps its neck, clamped in his huge jaws, then down in gulps he bolts its blood and guts. So King Agamemnon coursed his quarry, always cutting the straggler from the mass and they, they fled in terror, squads amok, spilling out of their chariots facefirst or slammed on their backs beneath Atrides' hands— storming and thrusting his spear and lunging on. But just as he was about to reach the steep city, up under the walls, the father of men and gods, descending out of the heavens, took his throne on the high ridge of Ida with all her springs. Holding fast in his grip a lightning bolt he drove Iris down in a rush of golden wings to bear his message: "Away with you now, Iris— quick as the wind and speed this word to Hector. So long as he sees lord marshal Agamemnon storming among the champions, mowing columns down in blood, Hector must hold back, command the rest of his men to fight the enemy, stand their headlong charge. But soon as a spear or bowshot wounds the king and Atrides mounts his chariot once again, then I will hand Hector the power to kill and kill till he cuts his way to the benched ships and the sun sinks and the blessed darkness sweeps across the earth." So he commanded. Wind-quick Iris obeyed at once and down from Ida's peaks she dove to sacred Troy, found the son of wise King Priam, shining Hector standing amidst his teams and bolted cars, and swift as a breeze beside him Iris called, "Hector, son of Priam—a mastermind like Zeus! The Father has sped me down to tell you this: so long as you see lord marshal Agamemnon storming among the champions, mowing columns down in blood, you must hold back, command the rest of your men to fight the enemy, stand their headlong charge! But soon as a spear or bowshot wounds the king and Atrides mounts his chariot once again— then Zeus will hand you the power to kill and kill till you cut your way to the benched ships and the sun sinks and the blessed darkness sweeps across the earth!" And Iris racing the wind went veering off. Hector leapt to ground from his chariot fully armed and brandishing two sharp spears went striding down his lines, ranging flank to flank, driving his fighters into battle, rousing grisly war—and round the Trojans whirled, bracing to meet the Argives face-to-face: but against their mass the Argives closed ranks, the fighting about to break, the troops squaring off and Atrides, tense to outfight them all, charged first. Sing to me now, you Muses who hold the halls of Olympus, who was the first to go up against King Agamemnon, who of the Trojans or famous Trojan allies? Iphidamas, the rough and rangy son of Anterior bred in the fertile land of Thrace, mother of flocks. Cisseus reared him at home when he was little— his mother's father who sired the fine beauty Theano— but once he hit the stride of his youth and ached for fame, Cisseus tried to hold him back, gave him a daughter's hand but warm from the bridal chamber marched the groom, fired up by word that Achaea's troops had landed. Twelve beaked ships sailed out in his command, trim vessels he left behind him in Percote, making his way to Troy to fight on foot and here he came now, up against Agamemnon, closer, closing . . . Atrides hurled and missed, his spearshaft just slanting aside the man's flank as Iphidamas went for the waist beneath the breastplate— he stabbed home, leaning into the blow full weight, trusting his heavy hand but failed to pierce the glittering belt, failed flat-out—the point, smashing against the silver, bent back like lead. And seizing the spearshaft powerful Agamemnon dragged it toward him, tussling like some lion and wrenching it free from Iphidamas' slack grasp he hacked his neck with a sword and loosed his limbs. And there he dropped and slept the sleep of bronze, poor soldier, striving to help his fellow Trojans, far from his wedded wife, his new bride . . . No joy had he known from her for all his gifts, the full hundred oxen he gave her on the spot then promised a thousand head of goats and sheep from the boundless herds he'd rounded up himself. Now the son of Atreus stripped him, robbed his corpse and strode back to his waiting Argive armies, hoisting the gleaming gear. But Coon marked him, Coon, Antenor's eldest son, a distinguished man-at-arms, and stinging grief went misting down his eyes for his fallen brother. In from the blind side he came— Agamemnon never saw him tensed with a spear and slashed him under the elbow, down the forearm— a glint of metal—the point ripped through his flesh and the lord of fighting men Atrides shuddered. Not that he quit the foray even then— he sprang at Coon, gripping his big spearshaft tough from the gusting wind that whipped its tree. Coon was just dragging his brother footfirst, wild now to retrieve his own father's son, calling for help from all the bravest men— but as Coon hauled the body through the press Agamemnon lunged up, under his bossed shield, thrust home hard with the polished bronze point, unstrung his limbs and reared and lopped his head and the head tumbled onto his fallen brother's corpse. So then and there under royal Agamemnon's hands the two sons of Antenor filled out their fates and down they plunged to the strong House of Death. But the king kept ranging, battling ranks on ranks and thrusting his spear and sword and hurling heavy rocks so long as the blood came flowing warm from his wound. But soon as the gash dried and firm clots formed, sharp pain came bursting in on Atrides' strength— spear-sharp as the labor-pangs that pierce a woman, agonies brought on by the harsh, birthing spirits, Hera's daughters who hold the stabbing power of birth— so sharp the throes that burst on Atrides' strength. And back he sprang in the car and told his driver to make for the hollow ships, racked with pain but he loosed a shrill cry to all his men: "Friends—lords of the Argives, 0 my captains! Your turn now-keep on shielding our fast ships from this latest mass attack. Zeus who rules the world forbids me to battle Trojans all day long." A crack of the lash and his driver whipped the team with streaming manes straight for the curved ships, and on they flew, holding nothing back, their heaving chests foaming, bellies pelted with dust, rushing the wounded warlord free and clear of battle. There—Hector's signal! Seeing Atrides hurt and speeding off the lines he gave a ringing shout to his troops and allies: "Trojans! Lycians! Dardan fighters hand-to-hand— now be men, my friends, call up your battle-fury! Their best man cuts and runs— Zeus is handing me glory, awesome glory. Drive your horses right at these mighty Argives, seize the higher triumph—seize it now!" Hector— whipping the fight and fire in each man like a huntsman crying on his hounds, their white fangs flashing, harrying savage game, some wild boar or lion— so at Achaea's ranks he drove his fearless Trojans, Hector son of Priam, a match for murderous Ares. The prince himself went wading into the front lines, his hopes soaring, and down he hurled on the fray like a sudden killer-squall that blasts down on the dark blue sea to whip and chop its crests. Who was the first he slaughtered, who the last, Hector the son of Priam, now Zeus gave him glory? Asaeus first, Autonous next and then Opites, Dolops, Clytius' son, and Opheltius, Agelaus, Aesymnus and Orus, Hipponous staunch in combat. These were the Argive captains Hector killed then went for the main mass like the West Wind battering soft shining clouds the South Wind wafts along—in deep explosive blasts it strikes and the great swelling waves roll on and on and the spray goes shooting up from under the wind's hurl swerving, roaring down the sea—so wildly Hector routed the packed lines of fighters caught in his onslaught. Now there would have been havoc, irreversible chaos, fleeing bands of Achaeans flung back on their ships if Odysseus had not shouted out to Diomedes, "What's wrong with us? Forgetting our battle-fury? Come here, old friend, stand by me! What humiliation— if Hector with that flashing helmet takes our ships!" Powerful Diomedes took his challenge quickly: "I'll stand and fight, by god, and take the worst but little joy it will bring our comrades now. Zeus the king of the clouds has pitched on victory for the Trojans, not for us." But all the same he hurled Thymbraeus down to ground from his car— Diomedes speared his left breast as Odysseus killed the warlord's aide-in-arms Molion tall as a god and left them there for dead, their fighting finished. Then both went thrashing into the lines to make a slaughter as two wild boars bristling, ramping back for the kill, fling themselves on the yelping packs that hunt them— back they whirled on attack and laid the Trojans low while Achaeans just in flight from Hector's onset leapt at the chance to gather second wind. At once they took two lords of the realm and seizieed their car, the two good sons of Merops out of Percote harbor, Merops adept beyond all men in the mantic arts. He refused to let his two boys march to war, this man-killing war, but the young ones fought him all the way—the forces of black death drove them on and Diomedes a marvel with a spear destroyed them both, stripped them of life breath and tore their gear away and Odysseus killed Hippodamus, killed Hypirochus. And there, gazing down from his ridge on Ida, the son of Cronus stretched the rope of battle tense and taut as the fighters kept on killing side-to-side. Diomedes hurled a spear that struck Agastrophus, Paeon's warrior son, and smashed the joint of his hip but his team was not close by for fast escape— a big mistake, the fool. His driver held them reined off at the side while he advanced through the front ranks on foot, plowing on and on till he lost his own life . . . But Hector quickly marked them across the lines— he charged them both full force with a savage shout and Trojan battalions churning in his wake. Diomedes shuddered to see him coming on, the lord of the war cry called out to Odysseus quickly, close beside him, "We're in for shipwreck— a breaker rolling down on us, look, this massive Hector! Brace for him, stand our ground together—beat him back!" He aimed and hurled and his spear's long shadow flew— a clean hit, no miss, trained at the head of Hector, his helmet ridge. But bronze glanced off bronze and never grazed firm flesh, the helmet blocked it, triple-ply with the great blank hollow eyes, a gift of Apollo. Sprinting a long way back, downfield and fast, Hector rejoined his men and sinking down onto one knee, propped himself with a strong hand planted against the earth— and the world went black as night across his eyes. But soon as Tydides followed up his spear, tracking its flight far down along the front where it stuck in sand, Hector caught his breath and boarding his car, drove for his own main force as he. hurtled clear of the dark fates of death— Diomedes shouting after him, shaking his spear, "Now, again, you've escaped your death, you dog, but a good close brush with death it was, I'd say! Now, again, your Phoebus Apollo pulls you through, the one you pray to, wading into our storm of spears. We'll fight again-I'll finish you off next time if one of the gods will only urge me on as well. But now I'll go for the others, anyone I can catch." And he set to stripping his kill, Paeon's spearman son. But at once Paris the lord of fair-haired Helen drew his bow at the rugged captain Diomedes . . . the archer leaning firmly against a pillar raised on the man-made tomb of Dardan's son, Ilus an old lord of the realm in ancient days. As Diomedes was stripping strong Agastrophus bare, tearing tke burnished breastplate off his victim's chest, the shield from his shoulders and heavy crested helmet, Paris, clenching the grip and drawing back his bow, shot!—no wasted shot, it whizzed from his hand and punched the flat top of Tydides' right foot, the shaft dug through and stuck fast in the ground. And loosing a heady laugh of triumph Paris leapt from his hiding-place and shouted out in glory, "Now you're hit—no wasted shot, my winging arrow! But would to god I'd hit you deep in the guts and ripped your life away! Then my Trojans could catch their breath again, reprieved from death-- they cringed at you like bleating goats before some lion." But never flinching, staunch Diomedes countered, "So brave with your bow and arrows—big bravado— glistening lovelocks, roving eye for girls! Come, try me in combat, weapons hand-to-hand— bow and spattering shafts will never help you then. You scratch my foot and you're vaunting all the same— but who cares? A woman or idiot boy could wound me so. The shaft of a good-for-nothing coward's got no point but mine's got heft and edge. Let it graze a man-- my weapon works in a flash and drops him dead. And his good wife will tear her cheeks in grief, his sons are orphans and he, soaking the soil red with his own blood, he rots away himself— more birds than women flocking round his body!" So he yelled and the famous spearman Odysseus rushed in close and reared up to shield him. Slipping behind, Tydides dropped to a knee and yanked the winged arrow from his foot as the raw pain went stabbing through his flesh. Back Diomedes jumped on his car and told his driver to make for the hollow ships—Tydides racked with pain. That left the famous spearman Odysseus on his own, not a single Argive comrade standing by his side since panic seized them all. Unnerved himself, Odysseus probed his own great fighting heart: "O dear god, what becomes of Odysseus now? A disgraceful thing if I should break and run, fearing their main force—but it's far worse if I'm taken all alone. Look, Zeus just drove the rest of my comrades off in panic flight. But why debate, my friend, why thrash things out? Cowards, I know, would quit the fighting now but the man who wants to make his mark in war must stand his ground and brace for all he's worth— suffer his wounds or wound his man to death." Weighing it all, heart and soul, as on they came, waves of Trojan shieldsmen crowding him tighter, closing in on their own sure destruction . . . like hounds and lusty hunters closing, ringing a wild boar till out of his thicket lair he crashes, whetting his white tusks sharp in his bent, wrenching jaws and they rush in to attack and under the barks and shouts you can hear the gnash of tusks but the men stand firm— terrible, murderous as he is—so the Trojans ringed Odysseus dear to Zeus, rushing him straight on. But he lunged first, wounding lordly Deiopites, spearshaft slicing into the Trojan's shoulder, then cut down Thoon and Ennomus in their blood, Chersidamas next, vaulting down from his car— Odysseus caught him up under the bulging shield with a jabbing spear that split him crotch to navel— the man writhed in the dust, hands clutching the earth. Odysseus left them dead and skewered Hippasus' son, one Charops the blood brother of wealthy Socus but Socus moved in quick as a god to shield his kin, standing up to his enemy, crying out, "Odysseus— wild for fame, glutton for cunning, glutton for war, today you can triumph over the two sons of Hippasus, killing such good men and stripping off their gear— or beaten down by my spear you'll breathe your last!" With that he stabbed at Odysseus' balanced shield, straight through the gleaming hide the heavy weapon drove, ripping down and in through the breastplate finely worked and it flayed the skin clean off Odysseus' ribs but Pallas Athena would never let it pierce her hero's vitals. Odysseus knew the end had not yet come—no final, fatal wound— and drawing back he hurled his boast at Socus: "Poor man, headlong death is about to overtake you! You've stopped my fighting against the Trojans, true, but I tell you here and now that a dark, bloody doom will take you down today—gouged by my spear you'll give me glory now, you'll give your life to the famous horseman Death!" And spinning in terror off he ran but as he spun Odysseus plunged a spear in his back between the shoulders— straight through his chest the shaft came jutting out and down Socus crashed, Odysseus vaunting over him: "Socus, son of Hippasus, skilled breaker of horses, so, Death in its rampage outraced you-no escape. No, poor soldier. Now your father and noble mother will never close your eyes in death—screaming vultures will claw them out of you, wings beating your corpse! But I, if I should die, my comrades-in-arms will bury me in style!" He dragged the heavy spear of hardened Socus squelching out of his own wound and bulging shield. As the fighter tore it out the blood came gushing forth and his heart sank. And seeing Odysseus bleeding there the Trojan troops exulted, calling across the melee, charging him in a mass as edging, backing off he gave ground now, calling his own companions. Three shattering cries he loosed at full pitch till Odysseus' head would burst—three times Menelaus tense for combat heard his cries and at once he called to Ajax standing near, "Ajax, royal son of Telamon, captain of armies, my ears ring with his cries—Odysseus never daunted. He sounds like a man cut off and overpowered, mauled by Trojan ranks in the rough assault. Quick through the onset—better save him now! I'm afraid he may be hurt, alone with the Trojans, brave as Odysseus is—a blow to all our troops." And Atrides led the way and Ajax took his lead, striding on like a god until they found Odysseus dear to Zeus but round him Trojans thronged like tawny jackals up in the mountains swarming round a homed stag just wounded—a hunter's hit him with one fast shaft from his bow and the stag's escaped, sprinting at top speed so long as his blood runs warm and the spring in his knees still lasts . . . But soon as the swift arrow saps his strength the ravening carrion packs begin their feasting off on a ridge in twilight woods until some god, some power drives a lion down against them—claw-mad and the panicked jackals scatter, the lion rends their prey. So packed around Odysseus skilled and quick to maneuver swarmed the brave bulk of Trojans—but still the hero kept on lunging, spearing, keeping death at bay. And in moved Ajax now, planted right beside him, bearing that shield of his like a wall, a tower— Trojans scattered in panic, bolting left and right while the fighting son of Atreus led Odysseus through the onslaught, bracing him with an arm till a reinsman drove his team and car up close. But charging down on the Trojans Ajax killed Doryclus, bastard son of Priam—he wounded Pandocus next, wounded Lysander, Pyrasus, then Pylartes. Wild as a swollen river hurling down on the flats, down from the hills in winter spate, bursting its banks with rain from storming Zeus, and stands of good dry oak, whole forests of pine it whorls into itself and sweeps along till it heaves a crashing mass of driftwood out to sea— so glorious Ajax swept the field, routing Trojans, shattering teams and spearmen in his onslaught. Nor had Hector once got wind of the rampage . . . far off on the left flank of the whole campaign he fought his way, powering past Scamander's banks where the heads of fighters fell in biggest numbers and grim incessant war cries rose around tall Nestor and battle-hard Idomeneus. Hector amidst them now engaged them with a vengeance, doing bloody work with lances flung and a master's horsemanship, destroying young battalions. Still the Achaeans never would have yielded before the prince's charge if Paris the lord of lovely fair-haired Helen had not put a stop to Machaon's gallant fighting, striking the healer squarely with an arrow triple-flanged that gouged his right shoulder. Achaeans breathing fury feared for Machaon now: what if the tide turned and Trojans killed the healer? Idomeneus suddenly called to Nestor, "Pride of Achaea! Quick, mount your chariot, mount Machaon beside you— lash your team to the warships, fast, full gallop! A man who can cut out shafts and dress our wounds— a good healer is worth a troop of other men." Nestor the noble charioteer did not resist. He mounted his car at once as Asclepius' son, Machaon born of the famous healer swung aboard. He lashed the team and on they flew to the ships, holding nothing back—that's where their spirits drove them on to go. But riding on with Hector Cebriones saw the Trojan rout and shouted, "Hector! Look at us here, engaging Argives with a vengeance, true, but off on the fringe of brutal all-out war while our central force is routed pell-mell, men and chariots flung against each other. Giant Ajax drives them—I recognize the man, that wall of a buckler slung around his shoulders. Hurry, head our chariot right where the fighting's thickest, there-horse and infantry hurling into the slaughter, hacking each other down, terrific war cries rising!" With that, Cebriones flogged their sleek team and leaping under the whistling, crackling whip they sped the careering car into both milling armies, trampling shields and corpses, axle under the chariot splashed with blood, blood on the handrails sweeping round the car, sprays of blood shooting up from the stallions' hoofs and churning, whirling rims. And Hector straining to wade into the press and panicked ruck of men, charge them, break them down—he flung terror and stark disaster square in the Argive lines, never pausing, giving his spear no rest. Hector kept on ranging, battling ranks on ranks, slashing his spear and sword and flinging heavy rocks but he stayed clear of attacking Ajax man-to-man. But Father Zeus on the heights forced Ajax to retreat. He stood there a moment, stunned, then swinging his seven-ply oxhide shield behind him, drew back in caution, throwing a fast glance at his own Achaean troops like a trapped beast, pivoting, backpedaling, step by short step . . . Like a tawny lion when hounds and country field hands drive him out of their steadings filled with cattle— they'll never let him tear the rich fat from the oxen, all night long they stand guard but the lion craves meat, he lunges in and in but his charges gain him nothing, thick-and-fast from their hardy arms the javelins rain down in his face, and waves of blazing torches— these the big cat fears, balking for all his rage, and at dawn he slinks away, his spirits dashed. So Ajax slowly drew back from the Trojans, spirits dashed, and*much against his will, fearing the worst for Achaea's waiting ships. Like a stubborn ass some boys lead down a road . . . stick after stick they've cracked across his back but he's too much for them now, he rambles into a field to ravage standing crops. They keep beating his ribs, splintering sticks—their struggle child's play till with one final shove they drive him off but not before he's had his fill of feed. So with Telamon's son Great Ajax then— vaunting Trojans and all their far-flung allies kept on stabbing his shield, full center, no letup. And now the giant fighter would summon up his fury, wheeling on them again, beating off platoons of the stallion-breaking Trojans—and now again he'd swerve around in flight. But he blocked them all from hacking passage through to the fast trim ships as Ajax all alone, battling on mid-field between Achaean and Trojan lines, would stand and fight. Some spears that flew from the Trojans' hardy arms, hurtling forward, stuck fast in his huge shield but showers of others, cut short halfway before they could graze his gleaming skin, stuck in the ground, still lusting to sink in flesh. But Euaemon's shining son Eurypylus saw him overwhelmed by the Trojans' dense barrage of spears. Up to his side he dashed and flanked Great Ajax tight, let fly with a spear and the glinting spearpoint hit the son of Phausias, Apisaon captain of armies, square in the liver, up under the midriff— his knees went limp as Eurypylus rushed in, starting to rip the armor off his shoulders. But now Paris spotted him stripping Apisaon, drew his bow at Eurypylus, fast—he shot well and the arrow struck him full in the right thigh but the shaft snapped, the thigh weighed down with pain. Eurypylus staggered back to his massing comrades, dodging death, and shouted a stark piercing cry: "Friends—lords of the Argives, all our captains! Come, wheel round-stand firm! Beat the merciless day of death from Ajax, overpowered, look, by a pelting rain of spears. He can't escape, I tell you, not this wrenching battle. Stand up to them—ring Great Ajax, Telamon's son." So wounded Eurypylus pleaded, friends around him crowding, bracing shields against their shoulders, spears brandished high and back to the bulking front came giant Ajax now. The fighter turned on his heels and took his stand, once he reached that wedge of Argive comrades. So on they fought like a mass of swirling fire as Neleus' foaming mares bore Nestor clear of battle and bore Machaon the expert healer too . . . But now the brilliant runner Achilles watched and marked him— there he stood on the stem of his looming hollow hull, looking out over the uphill work and heartsick rout of war. He called at once to his friend-in-arms Patroclus, shouting down from the decks. Hearing Achilles, forth he came from his shelter, striding up like the deathless god of war but from that moment on his doom was sealed. The brave son of Menoetius spoke out first: "Why do you call, Achilles? Do you need me?" And the swift runner Achilles answered quickly, "Son of Menoetius, soldier after my own heart, now I think they will grovel at my knees, our Achaean comrades begging for their lives. The need has reached them—a need too much to bear. Go now, Patroclus dear to Zeus, and question Nestor. Who's that wounded man he's bringing in from the fighting? He looks to me like Machaon from behind, clearly, Machaon head to foot, Asclepius' only son. But I never saw his eyes—the team sped by me, tearing on full tilt." Patroclus obeyed his great friend and off at a run he went along the ships and shelters. Now, as soon as the others reached Nestor's tent they climbed down on the earth that feeds us all. The driver Eurymedon freed the old man's team. The men themselves dried off their sweat-soaked shirts, standing against the wind that whipped along the surf, then entered the tent and took their seats on settles. And well-kempt Hecamede mixed them a bracing drink, the woman that old King Nestor won from Tenedos when Achilles stormed it, proud Arsinous' daughter, the prize the Achaeans chose to give to Nestor because he excelled them all at battle-tactics. First Hecamede pushed a table up toward them, handsome, sanded smooth, with blue enamel legs, and on it she set a basket, braided in bronze with onions in it, a relish for the drink, and pale gold honey along with barley meal, the grain's blessed yield. And there in the midst the grand, glowing cup the old king brought from home, studded with golden nails, fitted with handles, four all told and two doves perched on each, heads bending to drink and made of solid gold and twin supports ran down to form the base. An average man would strain to lift it off the table when it was full, but Nestor, old as he was, could hoist it up with ease. In this cup the woman skilled as a goddess mixed them a strong drink with Pramnian wine, over it shredded goat cheese with a bronze grater and scattered barley into it, glistening pure white, then invited them to drink when she had mulled it all. Now as the two men drank their parching thirst away and had just begun to please themselves with talk, confiding back and forth—there stood Patroclus tall at the threshold, vivid as a god . . . Old Nestor saw him at once and started up from his polished chair, warmly grasped his hand and led Patroclus in, pressing him to sit. But standing off to the side his guest declined: "No time to sit, old soldier dear to the gods. You won't persuade me. Awesome and quick to anger, the man who sent me here to find out who's been wounded, the one you've just brought in. But I can see him— I recognize Machaon myself, the expert healer. So back I go to give Achilles the message. Well you know, old soldier loved by the gods, what sort of man he is-that great and terrible man. Why, he'd leap to accuse a friend without a fault." But Nestor the noble charioteer replied at length, "Now why is Achilles so cast down with grief for this or that Achaean winged by a stray shaft? He has no idea of the anguish risen through the army! Look—our finest champions laid up in the ships, all hit by arrows or,run through by spears . . . there's powerful Diomedes brought down by an archer, Odysseus wounded, and Agamemnon too, the famous spearman, and Eurypylus took a shaft in the thigh, and here, Machaon—I just brought him in from the fighting, struck down by an arrow whizzing off the string. But Achilles, brave as he is, he has no care, no pity for our Achaeans. How long will he wait? Till our ships that line the shore go up in flames, gutted, despite a last-ditch stand? And we ourselves are mowed down in droves? And I, what good am I? My limbs are gnarled now, the old power's gone. Oh make me young again, and the strength inside me steady as a rock! As fresh as I was that time the feud broke out . . . fighting Epeans over a cattle-raid I killed Itymoneus, Hypirochus' gallant son who used to live in Elis. I was rustling their cattle in reprisal, you see, and he defending his herds, when a spear I hurled caught him right in the front ranks of herdsmen— down he went and round him his yokel drovers scattered home in panic. And what a lovely haul, what plunder we rounded up and herded off the plain! Fifty herds of cattle, as many head of sheep, as many droves of pigs and as many goat-flocks ranging free, a hundred and fifty horses too, strong and tawny, broodmares every one and under the flanks of many, nursing foals. The whole lot— we drove them all into Pylos then, that very night, corraling them all inside the walls of Neleus. And father beamed, seeing how much I'd won, a young soldier out on his first campaign. And the heralds cried out at the break of day, 'Pylians—come collect your debts from wealthy Elis!' And a troop of Pylian chiefs turned out in force to carve up the spoils. The Epeans owed us all, few as we were in Pylos, hard-pressed as well. For mighty Heracles came against us years before, he ground our lives out, killing off our best. Twelve sons we were of the noble old Neleus and I alone was left . . . the rest of my brothers perished in that rout. Riding high on our loss the Epeans rose in arms, lording over us, harassing us with outrage after outrage. So now, out of Epean spoils, the old king chose a herd of cattle and handsome flock of sheep, three hundred head he picked, the herdsmen too. For wealthy Elis owed my father a heavy debt: four prizewinning thoroughbreds, chariot and all. They'd gone to the games, primed to race for the tripod, but Augeas the warlord commandeered them on the spot and sent the driver packing, sick for his team. So now old Neleus, still enraged at it all— the threats to his man, the naked treachery— helped himself to a priceless treasure trove but gave the rest to his people to divide, so none would go deprived of his fair share. But just as we were parceling out the plunder and offering victims to the gods around the city, right on the third day they came, the Epeans massed in a swarm of men and plunging battle-stallions struck at the border, full force—and square in their midst the two Moliones armed to the hilt, and still boys, not quite masters yet in the ways of combat. Now then, there's a frontier fortress, Thryoessa perched on cliffs, far off above the Alpheus, at the edge of sandy Pylos. The Epeans ringed that fort, keen to raze its walls, but once their troops had swept the entire plain, down Athena rushed to us in the night, a herald down from Olympus crying out, 'To arms! to arms!' Nor did Pallas muster a slow, unwilling army there in Pylos, all of us spoiling for a fight. But Neleus would not let me arm for action— he'd hidden away my horses, thought his boy still green at the work of war. So I had to reach the front lines on foot but I shone among our horsemen all the same— that's how Athena called the turns of battle. Listen. There is a river, the Minyeos emptying into the sea beside Arene's walls, and there we waited for Goddess Dawn to rise, the Pylian horse in lines while squads of infantry came streaming up behind. Then, from that point on, harnessed in battle-armor, moving at forced march our army reached the Alpheus' holy ford at noon. There we slaughtered fine victims to mighty Zeus, a bull to Alpheus River, a bull to lord Poseidon and an unyoked cow to blazing-eyed Athena. And then through camp we took our evening meal by rank and file, and caught what sleep we could, each in his gear along the river rapids. And all the while those vaunting Epeans were closing round the fortress, burning to tear it down. But before they got the chance a great work of the War-god flashed before their eyes! Soon as the sun came up in flames above the earth we joined battle, lifting a prayer to Zeus and Pallas. And just as our two opposing armies clashed I was the first to kill a man and seize his team, the spearman Mulius, son-in-law to their king and wed to his eldest daughter, blond Agamede, skilled with as many drugs as the wide world grows. Just as he lunged I speared the man with a bronze lance and Mulius pitched in the dust as I, I swung aboard his car and I took my place in our front ranks of champions. How those hot-blooded Epeans scattered in terror! Scuttling left and right when they saw him down, their chariot captain who'd outfought them all. Now I charged their lines like a black tornado, I captured fifty chariots there, and each time two men bit the dust, crushed beneath my spear. Now I would have destroyed the young Moliones, Actor's sons—if their real father, Poseidon, lord god of the open sea who shakes the earth, had not snatched them out of the fighting then, shrouded them round in clouds. But now Zeus gave our Pylians stunning triumph! Pushing Epeans north on the spreading plain we went, killing their troops, gathering up their burnished gear, far as Buprasion rich in wheat our chariots rolled, all the way to Olenian Rock and the high ground they call Alesion Hill—but there, at last, Pallas Athena turned our forces back. I killed my last man there, I left him dead. There our Achaeans swung round from Buprasion, heading their high-strung horses back to Pylos where all gave glory to Zeus among the gods and among all men to Nestor. So, such was I in the ranks of men . . . or was it all a dream? This Achilles— he'll reap the rewards of that great courage of his alone, I tell you-weep his heart out far too late, when our troops are dead and gone. My friend, remember your father's last commands? That day he sent you out of Phthia to Agamemnon. We were both there inside, I and Prince Odysseus heard it all in the halls, all your father told you. We'd come to the strong and storied house of Peleus, out for recruits across Achaea's good green land. There inside we found the old soldier Menoetius, found you too, and Achilles close beside you, and the old horseman Peleus tending, burning the fat thighs of an ox to thundering Zeus, deep in the walled enclosure of his court. He was lifting a golden cup and pouring wine, glistening wine to go with the glowing victim. You two were busy over the carcass, carving meat when we both appeared and stood at the broad doors. Achilles sprang to his feet, he seemed startled, clasped the two of us by the hand and led us in— he pressed us to take a seat and set before us sumptuous stranger's fare, the stranger's right. And once we'd had our fill of food and drink, I led off with our plan, inviting the two of you to come campaign with us. How willing you were! And your fathers filled your ears with marching orders. The old horseman Peleus urging his son Achilles, 'Now always be the best, my boy, the bravest, and hold your head up high above the others.' And Actor's son Menoetius urging you, 'My child, Achilles is nobler than you with his immortal blood but you are older. He has more power than you, by far, but give him sound advice, guide him, even in battle. Achilles will listen to you—for his own good.' So the old man told you. You've forgotten. But even now, late as it is, you could tell your Achilles all this and your fiery friend might listen. Who knows? With a god's help you just might rouse him now, bring his fighting spirit round at last. The persuasion of a comrade has its powers. But if down deep some prophecy makes him balk, some doom his noble mother revealed to him from Zeus, at least let Achilles send Patroclus into battle. Let the whole Myrmidon army follow your command— you might bring some light of victory to our Argives! And let him give you his own fine armor to wear in war so the Trojans might take you for him, Patroclus, yes, hold off from attack, and Achaea's fighting sons get second wind, exhausted as they are . . . Breathing room in war is all too brief. You're fresh, unbroken. They're bone-weary from battle— you could roll those broken Trojans back to Troy, clear of our ships and shelters!" So old Nestor urged and the fighting spirit leapt inside Patroclus-- he dashed back by the ships toward Achilles. But sprinting close to King Odysseus' fleet where the Argives met and handed down their laws, the grounds where they built their altars to the gods, there he met Eurypylus, Euaemon's gallant son, wounded, the arrow planted deep in his thigh, and limping out of battle . . . The sweat was streaming down his face and back and the dark blood still flowed from his ugly wound but the man's will was firm, he never broke his stride. And moved at the sight, the good soldier Patroclus burst out in grief with a flight of winging words, "Poor men! Lords of the Argives, 0 my captains! How doomed you are, look-far from your loved ones and native land—to glut with your shining fat the wild dogs of battle here in Troy . . . But come, tell me, Eurypylus, royal fighter, can the Achaeans, somehow, still hold monstrous Hector?— or must they all die now, beaten down by his spear?" Struggling with his wound, Eurypylus answered, "No hope, Patroclus, Prince. No bulwark left. They'll all be hurled back to the black ships. All of them, all our best in the old campaigns are laid up in the hulls, they're hit by arrows, pierced by spears, brought down by Trojan hands while the Trojans' power keeps on rising, rising! Save me at least. Take me back to my black ship. Cut this shaft from my thigh. And the dark blood— wash it out of the wound with clear warm water. And spread the soothing, healing salves across it, the powerful drugs they say you learned from Achilles and Chiron the most humane of Centaurs taught your friend. And as for our own healers, Podalirius and Machaon, one is back in the shelters, wounded, I think— Machaon needs a good strong healer himself, he's racked with pain. The other's still afield, standing up to the Trojans' slashing onslaught." The brave son of Menoetius answered quickly, "Impossible. Eurypylus, hero, what shall we do? I am on my way with a message for Achilles, our great man of war—the. plan that Nestor, Achaea's watch and ward, urged me to report. But I won't neglect you, even so, with such a wound." And bracing the captain, arm around his waist, he helped him toward his shelter. An aide saw them and put some oxhides down. Patroclus stretched him out, knelt with a knife and cut the sharp, stabbing arrow out of Eurypylus' thigh and washed the wound clean of the dark running blood with clear warm water. Pounding it in his palms, he crushed a bitter root and covered over the gash to kill his comrade's pain, a cure that fought off every kind of pain . . . and the wound dried and the flowing blood stopped And so under shelter now Menoetius' fighting son was healing Eurypylus' wounds. But hordes of men fought on, the Achaean and Trojan infantry going hand-to-hand. The Argive trench could not hold out much longer, nor could the rampart rearing overhead, the wide wall they raised to defend the ships and the broad trench they drove around it all—they never gave the gods the splendid sacrifice the immortals craved, that the fortress might protect the fast ships and the bulking plunder heaped behind its, shield. Defying the deathless gods they built that wall and so it stood there steadfast no long time. While Hector still lived and Achilles raged on and the warlord Priam's citadel went unstormed, so long the Achaeans' rampart stood erect. But once the best of the Trojan captains fell, and many Achaeans died as well while some survived, and Priam's high walls were stormed in the tenth year and the Argives set sail for the native land they loved— then, at last, Poseidon and Lord Apollo launched their plan to smash the rampart, flinging into it all the rivers' fury. All that flow from the crests of Ida down to breaking surf, the Rhesus and the Heptaporus, Caresus and. the Rhodius, Grenicus and Aesepus, and the shining god Scamander and Simois' tides where tons of oxhide shields and homed helmets tumbled deep in the river silt and a race of men who seemed half god, half mortal. The channels of all those rivers—Apollo swung them round into one mouth and nine days hurled their flood against the wall and Zeus came raining down, cloudburst powering cloudburst, the faster to wash that rampart out to open sea. The Earth-shaker himself, trident locked in his grip, led the way, rocking loose, sweeping up in his breakers all the bastion's strong supports of logs and stones the Achaeans prized in place with grueling labor . . . He made all smooth along the rip of the Hellespont and piled the endless beaches deep in sand again and once he had leveled the Argives' mighty wall he turned the rivers flowing back in their beds again where their fresh clear tides had run since time began. So in the years to come Poseidon and god Apollo would set all things to rights once more. But now the war, the deafening crash of battle blazed around the strong-built work, and rampart timbers thundered under the heavy blows as Argive fighters beaten down by the lash of Zeus were rolled back, pinned to their beaked ships in dread of Hector, that invincible headlong terror. On he fought like a whirlwind, staunch as always— think of the hounds and huntsmen circling round some lion or boar when the quarry wheels at bay, rippling in strength as the men mass like a bastion standing up to his charge and hurl their pelting spears and the boar's brave spirit never flinches, never bolts and his own raw courage kills him—time and again he wheels around, testing the huntsmen's ranks and where he lunges out the ranks of men give way. So Hector lunged into battle, rallying cohorts now, spurring them on to cross the gaping trench— but his own rearing stallions lacked the nerve. They balked, whinnying shrill at the edge, the brink-- a dead stop-frightened off by the trench so broad the team could never leap it, not at a single bound, nor could they plunge on through with any ease. Steep banks overhung its whole length, jutting up on either side and topped by stabbing rows of stakes, planted there by the Argives, thickset and huge to block the enemy's onslaught. No light work for the teams that trundled chariots churning massive wheels to make it through in stride but the Trojans strained to bring it off on foot. So Polydamas stood by headstrong Hector, warning, "Hector—and all our Trojan captains, allies-in-arms! It's madness to drive our teams across that trench, impossible to traverse it. Look, the sharp stakes jutting right at the edge, and just beyond that the Achaeans' sturdy rampart. No room there for charioteers to dismount and fight it out, the strait's too narrow, cramped— we'll take a mauling there, I see it all! If mighty Zeus, thundering up on high, is bent on wiping out the Argives, down to the last man, if he longs to back our Trojan forces to the hilt, by heaven I hope the Father works his will at once and the Argives die here, their memory blotted out, a world away from Argos! But what if they round on us? If the Argives roll us back away from the ships, trapped and tangled there in the yawning trench, no runner, I tell you, pressed by an Argive rally, could struggle free and bear the news to Troy. So come, do as I say, and let us all unite. Drivers, rein your horses hard by the trench— the men themselves, armed for assault on foot, we all follow Hector, all in a mass attack. And the Argives? They cannot hold their line, not if the ropes of death are knotted round their necks!" So Polydamas urged. His plan won Hector over— less danger, more success—and down he leapt from his chariot fully armed and hit the ground. Nor did the other chariot-drivers hold formation— all dismounted, seeing shining Hector leap to earth. Each man shouted out commands to his driver, quickly, "Rein the team by the trench, good battle-order now!" And the fighters split apart and then closed ranks, marshaled in five battalions, captains leading each. The men who trooped with Hector and Prince Polydamas— they were the greatest force, the best and bravest, grim set above all the rest to breach the wall and go for the beaked ships and fight it out. Cebriones followed close, third in command since Hector left another to rein his team, a driver less than Cebriones, less a fighter. The second Trojan battalion Paris led in anus with Alcathous and Agenor. Helenus led the third with Deiphobus striding on like a god beside him, two sons of Priam; captain Asius third in command, Asius son of Hyrtacus—hulking, fiery stallions bore him in from Arisbe, from the Selleis River. The fourth battalion marched with gallant Aeneas, Anchises' offspring flanked by Antenor's two sons, Acamas and Archelochus drilled for every foray. Sarpedon marshaled the famous allies, placing Glaucus next in command with the combat veteran Asteropaeus, head and shoulders the best men, Sarpedon thought, after himself of course: he outshone the rest. Now shield against oxhide shield, wedging tight, with a wild rush they charged the Argives head-on, never thinking the Argive line could still hold out— they'd all be hurled back on their blackened hulls. So all the Trojans and famous friends-in-arms embraced Polydamas' plan, the faultless chieftain. But Asius captain of armies, Hyrtacus' son refused to leave his horses there with a driver reining back— and on he drove at the fast trim ships, chariot and all, the fool. Vaunting along the hulls with team and car but never destined to slip past the deadly spirits, never to ride in glory home to windswept Troy. Long before, his accursed doom blacked him out with Idomeneus' spear, Deucalion's noble son. Now left of the ships he sped where Argive ranks would head home from the plain with teams and cars. Here Asius flogged his team and chariot hard, nor did he find the gates shut, the bolt shot home, not yet, the men still held them wide, hoping to save some comrade fleeing, the onset, racing for the ships. Straight at the gates he lashed his team, hell-bent, his troops crowding behind him shouting war cries, never thinking the Argive line could stir hold out— they'd all be hurled back on their blackened hulls. Idiots. There in the gates they found two men, a brace of two great fighters, lionhearted sons of the Lapith spearmen, one Pirithous' offspring, rugged Polypoetes, the other Leonteus, a match for murderous Ares. Both warriors planted there before the towering gates rose like oaks that rear their crests on a mountain ridge, standing up to the gales and driving rains, day in,- day out, their giant roots branching, gripping deep in the earth: so these two, trusting all to their arms, their power, stood up to Asius' headlong charge and never shrank. On the Trojans came, straight for the rock-tight wall, raising rawhide shields and yelling their lungs out, grouped under captain Asius, lamenus and Orestes and Asius' own son Adamas, Thoon and Oenomaus. The Lapiths had just been rousing Argives packed behind the rampart: "Close in a ring—defend the ships!" But soon as the Lapiths saw the Trojans storm the wall, and cries broke from the Argives lost in sudden panic, then the two burst forth to fight before the gates like wild boars, a pair of them up on the hilltops bracing to take some breakneck rout of men and dogs and the two go slanting in on the charge, shattering timber round about them, shearing off the trunks at the roots and a grinding, screeching clatter of tusks goes up till a hunter spears them, tears their lives out— so the clatter screeched from the gleaming bronze that cased their chests as blows piled on blows. Deadly going, fighting now for all they were worth, staking all on their own strength and friends overhead as they ripped off rocks from the rampart's sturdy ledge and hurled them down, defending themselves, their shelters, their fast ships—the rocks pelted the ground like snow that a sudden squall in fury, driving the dark clouds, heaps thick-and-fast on the earth that feeds us all. So the missiles showering from their hands—Achaeans, Trojans, helmets and bossed shields clashing, ringing shrilly under the blows of boulders big as millstones. And now with a deep groan and pounding both thighs Asius son of Hyrtacus cried in anguish, "Father Zeus— so even you are an outright liar after all! I never dreamed these heroic Argive ranks could hold back our charge, our invincible arms. Look, like wasps quick and pinched at the waist or bees who build their hives on a rocky path, they never give up their hollow house, they hold on, keep the honey-hunters at bay, fight for their young. So these men will never budge from the gates though they're only two defenders— not till they kill us all or we kill them!" But his wailing failed to move the heart of Zeus: it was Zeus's pleasure to hand the prize to Hector. Now squad on squad, gate to gate they fought— but how can I tell it all, sing it all like a god? The strain is far too great. Everywhere round the wall the surging inhuman blaze of war leapt up the rocks— the Argives, desperate, had no choice, they struggled now to defend the ships, and the gods were cast down in spirit, all who had urged the Argive soldiers on in battle . . . But the Lapiths still kept fighting, slaughtering on. There—Pirithous' son the rugged Polypoetes skewered Damasus, pierced his bronze-sided helmet. None of the bronze plate could hold it, boring through the metal and skull the brazen spearpoint pounded, Damasus' brains splattered all inside his casque— Polypoetes beat him down despite the Trojan's rage, then Pylon and Ormenus, killed and stripped them both. And the tested veteran Leonteus speared Hippomachus, gouged Antimachus' offspring down across the belt, then drawing his long sharp sword from its sheath he rushed the front and took Antiphates first with a quick thrust, stabbing at close range— he slammed on his back, sprawled along the ground. Then Menon, Orestes, Iamenus—Leonteus killed the lot, crowding corpse on corpse on the earth that rears us all. While the Lapiths stripped their kills of gleaming gear the fighters trooping behind Polydamas and Hector, the greatest force, the best and bravest, grim set above all to breach the wall and torch the ships, still halted up at the trench, torn with doubt. For suddenly, just as the men tried to cross, a fatal bird-sign flashed before their eyes, an eagle flying high on the left across their front and clutching a monstrous bloody serpent in both talons, still alive, still struggling—it had not lost its fight, writhing back to strike it fanged the chest of its captor right beside the throat—and agonized by the bites the eagle flung it away to earth, dashed it down amidst the milling fighters, loosed a shriek and the bird veered off along the gusting wind. The Trojans shuddered to see the serpent glistening, wriggling at their feet, a sign from storming Zeus. And Polydamas stood by headstrong Hector, saying, "Hector, you always seem to attack me in assembly, despite my good advice. Never right, is it, for a common man to speak against you, King, never in open council, and god forbid in war. Our part is always to magnify your power. Well, once again I am bound to say what I think best. Stop the attack, don't fight them at their ships! All will end as the omen says, I do believe, if the bird-sign really came to us, the Trojans, just as our fighters tried to cross the trench. That eagle flying high on the left across our front, clutching this bloody serpent in both its talons, still alive—but he let the monster drop at once, before he could sweep it back to his own home . . . he never fed his nestlings in the end. Nor will we. Even if we can breach the Argives' gates and wall, assaulting in force, and the Argives give ground, back from the ships we'll come, back the way we went but our battle-order ruined, whole battalions of Trojans left behind and killed— the Achaeans will cut us down with bronze to save their fleet! So a knowing seer of the gods would read this omen, someone clear in his mind and skilled with signs, a man the Trojan armies would obey." His helmet flashing, Hector wheeled with a dark glance: "Enough, Polydamas! Your pleading repels me now— you must have something better than this to say. But if you are serious, speaking from the heart, the gods themselves have blotted out your senses. You tell me to forget the plans of storming Zeus, all he promised me when he nodded in assent? You tell me to put my trust in birds, flying off on their long wild wings? Never. I would never give them a glance, a second thought, whether they fly on the right toward the dawn and sunrise or fly on the left toward the haze and coming dark! No, no, put our trust in the will of mighty Zeus, king of the deathless gods and men who die. Bird-signs! Fight for your country—that is the best, the only omen! You, why are you so afraid of war and slaughter? Even if all the rest of us drop and die around you, grappling for the ships, you'd run no risk of death: you lack the heart to last it out in combat-coward! But if you hold back from the bloody foray here or turn some other soldier back from battle, winning him over—you with your soft appeals— at one quick stroke my spear will beat you down, you'll breathe your last!" Shouting he led the charge and his armies swarmed behind with blood-chilling cries. And above their onset Zeus who loves the lightning launched from Ida's summits a sudden howling gale that whipped a dust storm hard against the ships, spellbinding Achaean units in their tracks, handing glory to Hector and Hector's Trojans. Inspired by the signs and their own raw power all pitched in to smash the Achaeans' massive wall. They tore at the towers' outworks, pulled at battlements, heaving, trying to pry loose with levers the buttress stakes Achaeans first drove in the earth to shore the rampart up— they struggled to root these out, hoping to break down the Achaean wall itself. But not yet did the Argives give way to assault—no, they stopped the breaches up with oxhide shields and down from the breastwork heights they hurled rocks at the enemy coming on beneath the wall. And the two Aeantes ranged all points of the rampart, calling out commands to spur their comrades' fury. Now cheering a soldier on, tongue-lashing the next if they marked a straggler hanging back from battle: "Friends—you in the highest ranks of Argives, you in the midst and you in rank and file, we cannot all be equal in battle, ever, but now the battle lies before us all— come, see for yourselves, look straight' down. Now let no fighter be turned back to the ships, not with his captain's orders ringing in his ears-- keep pressing forward, shouting each other on! If only Olympian Zeus the lord of lightning grants us strength to repel this Trojan charge then carve a passage through to Troy's high walls!" So their cries urged on the Achaeans' war-lust. Thick-and-fast as the snows that fall on a winter dawn when Zeus who rules the world brings on a blizzard, displaying to all mankind his weaponry of war . . . and he puts the winds to sleep, drifting on and on until he has shrouded over the mountains' looming peaks and the headlands jutting sharp, the lowlands deep in grass and the rich plowed work of farming men, and the drifts fall on the gray salt surf and the harbors and down along the beaches and only breakers beating against the drifts can hold them off but all else on the earth they cover over, snows from the sky when Zeus comes storming down—now so thick-and-fast they volleyed rocks from both sides, some at the Trojans, some from Trojans against the Argives, salvos landing, the whole long rampart thundering under blows. But not even now would Trojans and Prince Hector have burst apart the rampart's gates and huge bar if Zeus the Master Strategist had not driven his own son Sarpedon straight at the Argives, strong as a lion raiding crook-homed cattle. Quickly Sarpedon swung his shield before him— balanced and handsome beaten bronze a bronzesmith hammered out with layer on layer of hide inside and stitched with golden rivets round the rim. That splendid shield he gripped before his chest and shaking a pair of spears went stalking out like a mountain lion starved for meat too long and the lordly heart inside him fires him up to raid some stormproof fold, to go at the sheep, and even if he should light on herdsmen at the spot, guarding their flocks with dogs and bristling spears, the marauder has no mind to be driven off that steading, not without an attack. All or nothing-he charges flocks and hauls off bloody prey or he's run through himself at the first assault with a fast spear driven home. So now the heart of Sarpedon stalwart as a god impelled him to charge the wall and break it down. He quickly called Hippolochus' son: "Glaucus, why do they hold us both in honor, first by far with pride of place, choice meats and brimming cups, in Lycia where all our people look on us like gods? Why make us lords of estates along the Xanthus' banks, rich in vineyards and plowland rolling wheat? So that now the duty's ours— we are the ones to head our Lycian front, brace and fling ourselves in the blaze of war, so a comrade strapped in combat gear may say, 'Not without fame, the men who rule in Lycia, these kings of ours who eat fat cuts of lamb and drink sweet wine, the finest stock we have. But they owe it all to their own fighting strength— our great men of war, they lead our way in battle!' Ah my friend, if you and I could escape this fray and live forever, never a trace of age, immortal, I would never fight on the front lines again or command you to the field where men win fame. But now, as it is, the fates of death await us, thousands poised to strike, and not a man alive can flee them or escape—so in we go for attack! Give our enemy glory or win it for ourselves!" Glaucus did not turn back or shun that call— on they charged, leading the Lycians' main mass. And Peteos' son Menestheus cringed to see them heading straight for his bastion, hurling ruin on . . . He scanned the Achaean rampart: where could he find some chief, some captain to fight disaster off his men? He spotted the Great and Little Ajax, gluttons for battle, flanking Teucer fresh from his shelter, side-by-side. But Menestheus could not reach them with a shout— the din was deafening, war cries hitting the skies, spears battering shields and helmets' horsehair crests and the huge gates all bolted shut, but against them there the Trojans tensed and heaved, trying to smash them down and force a passage through. At once Menestheus sped a herald to Ajax: "Run for it, quick one, call Great Ajax here— both of them, better yet, that's best of all. Headlong ruin's massing against us quickly. Lycia's captains are bearing down too hard, fierce as they always were in past attacks. But if fighting's flaring up in their own sector, at least let the rugged giant Ajax come alone with Teucer the master archer at his side." A brisk command, and the runner snapped to it-- he dashed along the wall of the Argive men-at-arms till he reached the two Aeantes, stopped and shouted, "Ajax—Ajax! Chiefs of the Argives armed in bronze, the favorite son of Peteos dear to immortals needs you at his strongpoint—hurry, come, just for a moment, meet the crisis there. Both of you, better yet, that's best of all. Headlong ruin's massing against us quickly. Lycia's captains are bearing down too hard, fierce as they always were in past attacks. But if fighting's flaring up in your own sector, at least let the rugged giant Ajax come alone with Teucer the master archer at his side!" And Telamon's giant son agreed at once. He called out to his smaller, faster brother with orders flying, "Ajax, you stay here, you and the burly Lycomedes stand your ground, keep our Danaans fighting here with all they've got. I'm on my way over there to meet this new assault— I'll soon be back, once I've helped our friends." And with that Telamonian Ajax strode off with his brother Teucer, his own father's son, and Pandion cradling Teucer's long curved bow. Holding close to the wall, they picked their way until they reached the brave Menestheus' bastion. There they found the defenders packed, hard-pressed as the Lycians' stalwart lords and captains stormed like a black tornado up against the breastworks— both men flung themselves in attack, the war cries broke. And Telamon's son was the first to kill his man, Sarpedon's comrade, Epicles great with heart. He brought him down with a glinting jagged rock, massive, top of the heap behind the rampart's edge, no easy lift for a fighter even in prime strength, working with both hands, weak as men are now. Giant Ajax hoisted it high and hurled it down, crushed the rim of the fighter's four-homed helmet and cracked his skull to splinters, bloody pulp— and breakneck down like a diver went the Trojan Plunging off and away from the steep beetling tower as life breath left his bones. And Glaucus next . . . Hippolochus' brawny son was scrambling up the wall when Teucer's arrow winged him from high aloft, just where he saw his shoulder blade laid bare, and stopped his lust for battle. Down he jumped from the wall in secret, fast, so no Achaean could see him hit and bellow out in triumph. Soon as he noticed Glaucus slipping clear, the pain overcame Sarpedon but even so he never forgot his lust for battle. He lunged in with a spear at Thestor's son Alcmaon, stabbed him, dragged out the shaft as the victim, caving into the spear's pull, pitched headfirst and his fine bronze armor clashed against his corpse. And Sarpedon clawing the rampart now with powerful hands, wrenched hard and the whole wall came away, planks and all and the rampart stood exposed, top defenses stripped— Sarpedon had made a gaping breach for hundreds. But Teucer and Ajax, aiming at him together, shot!—Teucer's arrow hitting the gleaming belt that cinched his body-shield around his chest— but Zeus brushed from his son the deadly spirits: not by the ships' high stems would his Sarpedon die. Ajax lunged at the man, he struck his shield but the point would not pierce through, so he beat him back in rage and he edged away from the breastwork just a yard. Not that Sarpedon yielded all the way, never, his heart still raced with hopes of winning glory, whirling, shouting back to his splendid Lycians, "Lycians—why do you slack your fighting-fury now? It's hard for me, strong as I am, single-handed to breach the wall and cut a path to the ships— come, shoulder-to-shoulder! The more we've got, the better the work will go!" So he called, and dreading their captain's scorn they bore down fiercer, massing round Sarpedon now but against their bulk the Argives closed ranks, packed tight behind the wall, and a desperate battle flared between both armies. Lycian stalwarts could not force the Achaeans back, breach their wall and burst through to the ships, nor could Achaean spearmen hurl the Lycians back, clear of the rampart, once they'd made their stand. As two farmers wrangle hard over boundary-stones, measuring rods in hand, locked in a common field, and fight it out on the cramped contested strip for equal shares of turf—so now the rocky bastion split the troops apart and across the top they fought, hacked at each other, chopped the oxhides round their chests, the bucklers full and round, skin-shields, tassels flying. Many were wounded, flesh ripped by the ruthless bronze whenever some fighter wheeled and bared his back but many right through the buckler's hide itself. Everywhere—rocks, ramparts, breastworks swam with the blood of Trojans, Argives, both sides, but still the Trojans could not rout the Argives. They held tight as a working widow holds the scales, painstakingly grips the beam and lifts the weight and the wool together, balancing both sides even, struggling to win a grim subsistence for her children. So powerful armies drew their battle line dead even till, at last, Zeus gave Hector the son of Priam the greater glory—the first to storm the wall. Hector loosed a piercing cry at his men: "Drive, drive, my stallion-breaking Trojans! Breach the Achaean rampart! Hurl your fire now— a blazing inferno of fire against their ships!" So he cried, driving them on, and all ears rang with his cries and a tight phalanx launched straight at the wall, brandishing sharp spears, swarming the bastions, as Hector grappled a boulder, bore it up and on. It stood at the gates, huge, blunt at the base but spiked to a jagged point and no two men, the best in the whole realm, could easily prize it up from earth and onto a wagon, weak as men are now—but he quickly raised and shook it as Zeus the son of Cronus with Cronus' twisting ways made it a light lift for Hector all on his own. As a shepherd lifts a ram's fleece with ease, plucks it up with a hand—no weight at all to him— so Hector raised the rock, bore it straight for the doors that blocked the gateway, powerful, thickset, the pair towering up with two bars on the inside, crossing over each other, shot home with a bolt to pin them firm. Planting his body right in front, legs spread wide, his weight in the blow to give it total impact, Hector hurled at the gates, full center, smashing the hinges left and right and the boulder tore through, dropped with a crash and both gates groaned and thundered— the doorbars could not hold, the planking shattered up in a flying storm of splinters under the rock's force and Hector burst through in glory, his face dark as the sudden rushing night but he blazed on in bronze and terrible fire broke from the gear that wrapped his body, two spears in his fists. No one could fight him, stop him, none but the gods as Hector hurtled through the gates and his eyes flashed fire. And whirling round he cried to his Trojans, shouting through the ruck, "The wall, storm the wall!" They rushed to obey him, some swarming over the top at once, others streaming in through the sturdy gateways—Argives scattering back in terror, back by the hollow hulls, the uproar rising, no way out, no end— Athena Inspires the Prince Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turns ... driven time and again off course, once he had plundered the hallowed heights of Troy. Many cities of men he saw and learned their minds, many pains he suffered, heartsick on the open sea, fighting to save his life and bring his comrades home. But he could not save them from disaster, hard as he strove — the recklessness of their own ways destroyed them all, the blind fools, they devoured the cattle of the Sun and the Sungod blotted out the day of their return. Launch out on his story. Muse, daughter of Zeus, start from where you will — sing for our time too. By now, all the survivors, all who avoided headlong death were safe at home, escaped the wars and waves. But one man alone ... his heart set on his wife and his return — Calypso, the bewitching nymph, the lustrous goddess, held him back, deep in her arching caverns, craving him for a husband. But then, when the wheeling seasons brought the year around, that year spun out by the gods when he should reach his home, Ithaca — though not even there would he be free of trials, even among his loved ones — then every god took pity, all except Poseidon. He raged on, seething against the great Odysseus till he reached his native land. But now Poseidon had gone to visit the Ethiopians worlds away, Ethiopians off at the farthest limits of mankind, a people split in two, one part where the Sungod sets and part where the Sungod rises. There Poseidon went to receive an offering, bulls and rams by the hundred — far away at the feast the Sea-lord sat and took his pleasure. But the other gods, at home in Olympian Zeus's halls, met for full assembly there, and among them now the father of men and gods was first to speak, sorely troubled, remembering handsome Aegisthus, the man Agamemnon's son, renowned Orestes, killed. Recalling Aegisthus, Zeus harangued the immortal powers: "Ah how shameless — ^the way these mortals blame the gods. From us alone, they say, come all their miseries, yes, but they themselves, with their own reckless ways, compound their pains beyond their proper share. Look at Aegisthus now ... above and beyond Azs share he stole Atrides' wife, he murdered the warlord coming home from Troy though he knew it meant his own total ruin. Far in advance we told him so ourselves, dispatching the guide, the giant-killer Hermes. 'Don't murder the man,' he said, 'don't court his wife. Beware, revenge will come from Orestes, Agamemnon's son, that day he comes of age and longs for his native land.' So Hermes warned, with all the good will in the world. but would Aegisthus' hardened heart give way? Now he pays the price — all at a single stroke." And sparkling-eyed Athena drove the matter home: "Father, son of Cronus, our high and mighty king, surely he goes down to a death he earned in full! Let them all die so, all who do such things. But my heart breaks for Odysseus, that seasoned veteran cursed by fate so long — far from his loved ones still, he suffers torments off on a wave-washed island rising at the center of the seas. A dark wooded island, and there a goddess makes her home, daughter of Atlas, wicked Titan who sounds the deep in all its depths, whose shoulders lift on high the colossal pillars thrusting earth and sky apart. Atlas' daughter it is who holds Odysseus captive, luckless man — despite his tears, forever trying to spellbind his heart with suave, seductive words and wipe all thought of Ithaca from his mind. But he, straining for no more than a glimpse of hearth-smoke drifting up from his own land, Odysseus longs to die ... Olympian Zeus, have you no care for him 'm your lofty heart? Did he never win your favor with sacrifices burned beside the ships on the broad plain of Troy? Why, Zeus, why so dead set against Odysseus?" "My child," Zeus who marshals the thunderheads replied, "what nonsense you let slip through your teeth. Now, how on earth could 1 forget Odysseus? Great Odysseus who excels all men in wisdom, excels in offerings too he gives the immortal gods who rule the vaulting skies? No, it's the Earth-Shaker, Poseidon, unappeased, forever fuming against him for the Cyclops whose giant eye he blinded: godlike Polyphemus, towering over all the Cyclops' clans in power. The nymph Thoosa bore him, daughter of Phorcys, lord of the barren salt sea — she met Poseidon once in his vaulted caves and they made love. And now for his blinded son the earthquake god — though he won't quite kill Odysseus — drives him far off course from native land. But come, all of us here put heads together now, work out his journey home so Odysseus can return. Lord Poseidon, 1 trust, will let his anger go. How can he stand his ground against the will of all the gods at once — one god alone?" Athena, her eyes flashing bright, exulted, "Father, son of Cronus, our high and mighty king! If now it really pleases the blissful gods that wise Odysseus shall return — home at last — let us dispatch the guide and giant-killer Hermes down to Ogygia Island, down to announce at once to the nymph with lovely braids our fixed decree: Odysseus journeys home — ^the exile must return! While 1 myself go down to Ithaca, rouse his son to a braver pitch, inspire his heart with courage to summon the flowing-haired Achaeans to full assembly, speak his mind to all those suitors, slaughtering on and on his droves of sheep and shambling longhorn cattle. Next 1 will send him off to Sparta and sandy Pylos, there to learn of his dear father's journey home. Perhaps he will hear some news and make his name throughout the mortal world. " So Athena vowed and under her feet she fastened the supple sandals, ever-glowing gold, that wing her over the waves and boundless earth with the rush of gusting winds. She seized the rugged spear tipped with a bronze point — weighted, heavy, the massive shaft she wields to break the lines of heroes the mighty Father's daughter storms against. And down she swept from Olympus' craggy peaks and lit on Ithaca, standing tall at Odysseus' gates. the threshold of his court. Gripping her bronze spear, she looked for all the world like a stranger now, like Mentes, lord of the Taphians. There she found the swaggering suitors, just then amusing themselves with rolling dice before the doors, lounging on hides of oxen they had killed themselves. While heralds and brisk attendants bustled round them, some at the mixing-bowls, mulling wine and water, others wiping the tables down with sopping sponges, setting them out in place, still other servants jointed and carved the great sides of meat. First by far to see her was Prince Telemachus, sitting among the suitors, heart obsessed with grief. He could almost see his magnificent father, here ... in the mind's eye — if only might drop from the clouds and drive these suitors all in a rout throughout the halls and regain his pride of place and rule his own domains! Daydreaming so as he sat among the suitors, he glimpsed Athena now and straight to the porch he went, mortified that a guest might still be standing at the doors. Pausing beside her there, he clasped her right hand and relieving her at once of her long bronze spear, met her with winged words: "Greetings, stranger! Here in our house you'll find a royal welcome. Have supper first, then tell us what you need." He led the way and Pallas Athena followed. Once in the high-roofed hall, he took her lance and fixed it firm in a burnished rack against a sturdy pillar, there where row on row of spears, embattled Odysseus' spears, stood stacked and waiting. Then he escorted her to a high, elaborate chair of honor, over it draped a cloth, and here he placed his guest with a stool to rest her feet. But for himself he drew up a low reclining chair beside her, richly painted, clear of the press of suitors. concerned his guest, offended by their uproar, might shrink from food in the midst of such a mob. He hoped, what's more, to ask him about his long-lost father. A maid brought water soon in a graceful golden pitcher and over a silver basin tipped it out so they might rinse their hands, then pulled a gleaming table to their side. A staid housekeeper brought on bread to serve them, appetizers aplenty too, lavish with her bounty. A carver lifted platters of meat toward them, meats of every sort, and set beside them golden cups and time and again a page came round and poured them wine. But now the suitors trooped in with all their swagger and took their seats on low and high-backed chairs. Heralds poured water over their hands for rinsing, serving maids brought bread heaped high in trays and the young men brimmed the mixing-bowls with wine. They reached out for the good things that lay at hand, and when they 'd put aside desire for food and drink the suitors set their minds on other pleasures, song and dancing, all that crowns a feast. A herald placed an ornate lyre in Phemius' hands, the bard who always performed among them there; they forced the man to sing. A rippling prelude — and no sooner had he struck up his rousing song than Telemachus, head close to Athena's sparkling eyes, spoke low to his guest so no one else could hear: "Dear stranger, would you be shocked by what 1 say? Look at them over there. Not a care in the world, just lyres and tunes! Easy for them, all right, they feed on another's goods and go scot-free — a man whose white bones lie strewn in the rain somewhere, rotting away on land or rolling down the ocean's salty swells. But that man — if they caught sight of him home in Ithaca, by god, they 'd all pray to be faster on their feet than richer in bars of gold and heavy robes. But now, no use, he's died a wretched death. No comfort's left for us ... not even if someone, somewhere, says he's coming home. The day of his return will never dawn. Enough. Tell me about yourself now, clearly, point by point. Who are you? where are you from? your city? your parents? What sort of vessel brought you? Why did the sailors land you here in Ithaca? Who did they say they are? 1 hardly think you came this way on foot! And tell me this for a fact — 1 need to know — is this your first time here? Or are you a friend of father's, a guest from the old days? Once, crowds of other men would come to our house on visits — visitor that he was, when he walked among the living." Her eyes glinting, goddess Athena answered, "My whole story, of course, I'll tell it point by point. Wise old Anchialus was my father. My own name is Mentes, lord of the Taphian men who love their oars. And here I've come, just now, with ship and crew, sailing the wine-dark sea to foreign ports of call, to Temese, out for bronze — our cargo gleaming iron. Our ship lies moored off farmlands far from town, riding in Rithron Cove, beneath Mount Nion's woods. As for the ties between your father and myself, we've been friends forever, I'm proud to say, and he would bear me out if you went and questioned old lord Laertes. He, 1 gather, no longer ventures into town but lives a life of hardship, all to himself, off on his farmstead with an aged serving-woman who tends him well, who gives him food and drink when weariness has taken hold of his withered limbs from hauling himself along his vineyard's steep slopes. And now I've come — and why? 1 heard that he was back ... your father, that is. But no, the gods thwart his passage. Yet 1 tell you great Odysseus is not dead. He's still alive. somewhere in this wide world, held captive, out at sea on a wave-washed island, and hard men, savages, somehow hold him back against his will. Wait, I'll make you a prophecy, one the immortal gods have planted in my mind — it will come true, 1 think, though I'm hardly a seer or know the flights of birds. He won't be gone long from the native land he loves, not even if iron shackles bind your father down. He's plotting a way to journey home at last; he's never at a loss. But come, please, tell me about yourself now, point by point. You're truly Odysseus' son? You've sprung up so! Uncanny resemblance ... the head, and the fine eyes — 1 see him now. How often we used to meet in the old days before he embarked for Troy, where other Argive captains, all the best men, sailed in the long curved ships. From then to this very day I've not set eyes on Odysseus or he on me. " And young Telemachus cautiously replied, "I'll try, my friend, to give you a frank answer. Mother has always told me I'm his son, it's true, but 1 am not so certain. Who, on his own, has ever really known who gave him life? Would to god I'd been the son of a happy man whom old age overtook in the midst of his possessions! Now, think of the most unlucky mortal ever born — since you ask me, yes, they say 1 am his son." "Still," the clear-eyed goddess reassured him, "trust me, the gods have not marked out your house for such an unsung future, not if Penelope has borne a son like you. But tell me about all this and spare me nothing. What's this banqueting, this crowd carousing here? And what part do you play yourself? Some wedding-feast. some festival? Hardly a potluck supper, 1 would say. How obscenely they lounge and swagger here, look, gorging in your house. Why, any man of sense who chanced among them would be outraged, seeing such behavior. " Ready Telemachus took her up at once: "Well, my friend, seeing you want to probe and press the question, once this house was rich, no doubt, beyond reproach when the man you mentioned still lived here, at home. Now the gods have reversed our fortunes with a vengeance — wiped that man from the earth like no one else before. 1 would never have grieved so much about his death if he'd gone down with comrades off in Troy or died in the arms of loved ones, once he had wound down the long coil of war. Then all united Achaea would have raised his tomb and he'd have won his son great fame for years to come. But now the whirlwinds have ripped him away, no fame for him! He's lost and gone now — out of sight, out of mind — and 1 ... he's left me tears and grief. Nor do 1 rack my heart and grieve for him alone. No longer. Now the gods have invented other miseries to plague me. Listen. All the nobles who rule the islands round about, Dulichion, and Same, and wooded Zacynthus too, and all who lord it in rocky Ithaca as well — down to the last man they court my mother, they lay waste my house! And mother ... she neither rejects a marriage she despises nor can she bear to bring the courting to an end — while they continue to bleed my household white. Soon — you wait — ^they'll grind /nedown as well." "Shameful!"— brimming with indignation, Pallas Athena broke out. "Oh how much you need Odysseus, gone so long — how (C/lay hands on all these brazen suitors! If only he would appear, now. at his house's outer gates and take his stand, armed with his helmet, shield and pair of spears, as strong as the man I glimpsed that first time in our own house, drinking wine and reveling there ... just come in from Ephyra, visiting Ilus, Mermerus' son. Odysseus sailed that way, you see, in his swift trim ship, hunting deadly poison to smear on his arrows' bronze heads. Ilus refused — he feared the wrath of the everlasting gods — but father, so fond of him, gave him all he wanted. If only ^Aa^ Odysseus sported with these suitors, a blood wedding, a quick death would take the lot! True, but all lies in the lap of the great gods, whether or not he'll come and pay them back, here, in his own house. But you, 1 urge you, think how to drive these suitors from your halls. Come now, listen closely. Take my words to heart. At daybreak summon the island's lords to full assembly, give your orders to all and call the gods to witness: tell the suitors to scatter, each to his own place. As for your mother, if the spirit moves her to marry, let her go back to her father's house, a man of power. Her kin will arrange the wedding, provide the gifts, the array that goes with a daughter dearly loved. For you, 1 have some good advice, if only you will accept it. Fit out a ship with twenty oars, the best in sight, sail in quest of news of your long-lost father. Someone may tell you something or you may catch a rumor straight from Zeus, rumor that carries news to men like nothing else. First go down to Pylos, question old King Nestor, then cross over to Sparta, to red-haired Menelaus, of all the bronze-armored Achaeans the last man back. Now, if you hear your father's alive and heading home, hard-pressed as you are, brave out one more year. If you hear he's dead, no longer among the living, then back you come to the native land you love. raise his grave-mound, build his honors high with the full funeral rites that he deserves — and give your mother to another husband. Then, once you've sealed those matters, seen them through, think hard, reach down deep in your heart and soul for a way to kill these suitors in your house, by stealth or in open combat. You must not cling to your boyhood any longer — it's time you were a man. Haven't you heard what glory Prince Orestes won throughout the world when he killed that cunning, murderous Aegisthus, who'd killed his famous father? And you, my friend — how tall and handsome 1 see you now — be brave, you too, so men to come will sing your praises down the years. But now 1 must go back to my swift trim ship and all my shipmates, chafing there, I'm sure, waiting for my return. It all rests with you. Take my words to heart." "Oh stranger," heedful Telemachus replied, "indeed 1 will. You've counseled me with so much kindness now, like a father to a son. 1 won't forget a word. But come, stay longer, keen as you are to sail, so you can bathe and rest and lift your spirits, then go back to your ship, delighted with a gift, a prize of honor, something rare and fine as a keepsake from myself. The kind of gift a host will give a stranger, friend to friend." Her eyes glinting, Pallas declined in haste: "Not now. Don't hold me here. 1 long to be on my way. As for the gift — whatever you'd give in kindness — save it for my return so 1 can take it home. Choose something rare and fine, and a good reward that gift is going to bring you." With that promise. off and away Athena the bright-eyed goddess flew Uke a bird in soaring flight but left his spirit filled with nerve and courage, charged with his father's memory more than ever now. He felt his senses quicken, overwhelmed with wonder — this was a god, he knew it well and made at once for the suitors, a man like a god himself. Amidst them still the famous bard sang on, and they sat in silence, listening as he performed The Achaeans' Journey Home from Troy, all the blows Athena doomed them to endure. And now, from high above in her room and deep in thought, she caught his inspired strains ... Icarius' daughter Penelope, wary and reserved, and down the steep stair from her chamber she descended, not alone: two of her women followed close behind. That radiant woman, once she reached her suitors, drawing her glistening veil across her cheeks, paused now where a column propped the sturdy roof, with one of her loyal handmaids stationed either side. Suddenly, dissolving in tears and bursting through the bard's inspired voice, she cried out, "Phemius! So many other songs you know to hold us spellbound, works of the gods and men that singers celebrate. Sing one of those as you sit beside them here and they drink their wine in silence. But break off this song — the unendurable song that always rends the heart inside me ... the unforgettable grief, it wounds me most of all! How 1 long for my husband — alive in memory, always, that great man whose fame resounds through Hellas right to the depths of Argos!" "Why, mother," poised Telemachus put in sharply, "why deny our devoted bard the chance to entertain us any way the spirit stirs him on? Bards are not to blame — Zeus is to blame. He deals to each and every laborer on this earth whatever doom he pleases. Why fault the bard if he sings the Argives' harsh fate? It's always the latest song, the one that echoes last in the listeners' ears, that people praise the most. Courage, mother. Harden your heart, and listen. Odysseus was scarcely the only one, you know, whose journey home was blotted out at Troy. Others, so many others, died there too. So, mother, go back to your quarters. Tend to your own tasks, the distaff and the loom, and keep the women working hard as well. As for giving orders, men will see to that, but 1 most of all: /hold the reins of power in this house. " Astonished, she withdrew to her own room. She took to heart the clear good sense in what her son had said. Climbing up to the lofty chamber with her women, she fell to weeping for Odysseus, her beloved husband, till watchful Athena sealed her eyes with welcome sleep. But the suitors broke into uproar through the shadowed halls, all of them lifting prayers to lie beside her, share her bed, until discreet Telemachus took command: "You suitors who plague my mother, you, you insolent, overweening ... for this evening let us dine and take our pleasure, no more shouting now. What a fine thing it is to listen to such a bard as we have here — the man sings like a god. But at first light we all march forth to assembly, take our seats so 1 can give my orders and say to you straight out: You must leave my palace! See to your feasting elsewhere, devour your own possessions, house to house by turns. But if you decide the fare is better, richer here, destroying one man's goods and going scot-free, all right then, carve away! But I'll cry out to the everlasting gods in hopes that Zeus will pay you back with a vengeance — all of you destroyed in my house while /go scot-free myself! " So Telemachus declared. And they all bit their lips, amazed the prince could speak with so much daring. Eupithes' son Antinous broke their silence: "Well, Telemachus, only the gods could teach you to sound so high and mighty! Such brave talk. 1 pray that Zeus will never make youVinq of Ithaca, though your father's crown is no doubt yours by birth." But cool-headed Telemachus countered firmly: "Antinous, even though my words may offend you, I'd be happy to take the crown if Zeus presents it. You think that nothing worse could befall a man? It's really not so bad to be a king. All at once your palace grows in wealth, your honors grow as well. But there are hosts of other Achaean princes, look — young and old, crowds of them on our island here — and any one of the lot might hold the throne, now great Odysseus is dead ... But /77be lord of my own house and servants, all that King Odysseus won for me by force." And now Eurymachus, Polybus' son, stepped in: "Surely this must lie in the gods' lap, Telemachus — which Achaean will lord it over seagirt Ithaca. Do hold on to your own possessions, rule your house. God forbid that anyone tear your holdings from your hands while men still live in Ithaca. But about your guest, dear boy, 1 have some questions. Where does he come from? Where's his country, his birth, his father's old estates? Did he bring some news of your father, his return? Or did he come on business of his own? How he leapt to his feet and off he went! No waiting around for proper introductions. And no mean man, not by the looks of him, I'd say." "Eurymachus," Telemachus answered shrewdly, "clearly my father 's journey home is lost forever. 1 no longer trust in rumors — rumors from the blue — nor bother with any prophecy, when mother calls some wizard into the house to ask him questions. As for the stranger though, the man's an old family friend, from Taphos, wise Anchialus' son. He says his name is Mentes, lord of the Taphian men who love their oars. " So he said but deep in his mind he knew the immortal goddess. Now the suitors turned to dance and song, to the lovely beat and sway, waiting for dusk to come upon them there ... and the dark night came upon them, lost in pleasure. Finally, to bed. Each to his own house. Telemachus, off to his bedroom built in the fine courtyard — a commanding, lofty room set well apart — retired too, his spirit swarming with misgivings. His devoted nurse attended him, bearing a glowing torch, Eurycleia the daughter of Ops, Pisenor's son. Laertes had paid a price for the woman years ago, still in the bloom of youth. He traded twenty oxen, honored her on a par with his own loyal wife at home but fearing the queen's anger, never shared her bed. She was his grandson's escort now and bore a torch, for she was the one of all the maids who loved the prince the most — she'd nursed him as a baby. He spread the doors of his snug, well-made room, sat down on the bed and pulled his soft shirt off, tossed it into the old woman's conscientious hands, and after folding it neatly, patting it smooth, she hung it up on a peg beside his corded bed, then padded from the bedroom. drawing the door shut with the silver hook, sliding the door bolt home with its rawhide strap. There all night long, wrapped in a sheep's warm fleece, he weighed in his mind the course Athena charted. Telemachus Sets Sail when young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more the true son of Odysseus sprang from bed and dressed, over his shoulder he slung his well-honed sword, fastened rawhide sandals under his smooth feet and stepped from his bedroom, handsome as a god. At once he ordered heralds to cry out loud and clear and summon the flowing-haired Achaeans to full assembly. Their cries rang out. The people filed in quickly. When they'd grouped, crowding the meeting grounds, Telemachus strode in too, a bronze spear in his grip and not alone: two sleek hounds went trotting at his heels. And Athena lavished a marvelous splendor on the prince so the people all gazed in wonder as he came forward, the elders making way as he took his father's seat. The first to speak was an old lord, Aegyptius, stooped with age, who knew the world by heart. For one dear son had sailed with King Odysseus, bound in the hollow ships to the stallion-land of Troy — the spearman Antiphus — but the brutal Cyclops killed him, trapped in his vaulted cave, the last man the monster ate. Three other sons he had: one who mixed with the suitors, Eurynomus, and two kept working their father's farms. Still, he never forgot the soldier, desolate in his grief. In tears for the son he lost, he rose and said among them, "Hear me, men of Ithaca. Hear what 1 have to say. Not once have we held assembly, met in session since King Odysseus sailed in the hollow ships. Who has summoned us now — one of the young men, one of the old-timers? What crisis spurs him on? Some news he's heard of an army on the march, word he's caught firsthand so he can warn us now? Or some other public matter he'll disclose and argue? He's a brave man, I'd say. God be with him, too! May Zeus speed him on to a happy end, whatever his heart desires!" Winning words with a lucky ring. Odysseus' son rejoiced; the boy could sit no longer — fired up to speak, he took his stand among the gathered men. The herald Pisenor, skilled in custom's ways, put the staff in his hand, and then the prince, addressing old Aegyptius first, led off with, "Sir, that man is not far off — you'll soon see for yourself — /was the one who called us all together. Something wounds me deeply ... not news I've heard of an army on the march, word I've caught firsthand so 1 can warn you now, or some other public matter I'll disclose and argue. No, the crisis is my own. Trouble has struck my house — a double blow. First, 1 have lost my noble father who ruled among you years ago, each of you here, and kindly as a father to his children. But now this. a worse disaster that soon will grind my house down, ruin it all, and all my worldly goods in the bargain. Suitors plague my mother — against her will — sons of the very men who are your finest here! They'd sooner die than approach her father's house so Icarius himself might see to his daughter's bridal, hand her to whom he likes, whoever meets his fancy. Not they — they infest our palace day and night, they butcher our cattle, our sheep, our fat goats, feasting themselves sick, swilling our glowing wine as if there's no tomorrow — all of it, squandered. Now we have no man like Odysseus in command to drive this curse from the house. We ourselves? We're hardly the ones to fight them off. All we'd do is parade our wretched weakness. A boy inept at battle. Oh I'd swing to attack if 1 had the power in me. By god, it's intolerable, what they do — disgrace, my house a shambles! You should be ashamed yourselves, mortified in the face of neighbors living round about! Fear the gods' wrath — before they wheel in outrage and make these crimes recoil on your heads. 1 beg you by Olympian Zeus, by Themis too, who sets assemblies free and calls us into session — stop, my friends! Leave me alone to pine away in anguish ... Unless, of course, you think my noble father Odysseus did the Achaean army damage, deliberate harm, and to pay me back you'd do me in, deliberately setting these parasites against me. Better for me if youynere devouring all my treasure, all my cattle — if you were the ones, we'd make amends in no time. We'd approach you for reparations round the town, demanding our goods till you'd returned the lot. But now, look, you load my heart with grief — there's nothing 1 can do!" Filled with anger, down on the ground he dashed the speaker's scepter — bursting into tears. Pity seized the assembly. All just sat there, silent ... no one had the heart to reply with harshness. Only Antinous, who found it in himself to say, "So high and mighty, Telemachus — such unbridled rage! Well now, fling your accusations at us? Think to pin the blame on us?Yo\x think again. It's not the suitors here who deserve the blame, it's your own dear mother, the matchless queen of cunning. Look here. For three years now, getting on to four, she's played it fast and loose with all our hearts, building each man's hopes — dangUng promises, dropping hints to each — but all the while with something else in mind. rA/5 was her latest masterpiece of guile: she set up a great loom in the royal halls and she began to weave, and the weaving finespun, the yarns endless, and she would lead us on: 'Young men, my suitors, now that King Odysseus is no more, go slowly, keen as you are to marry me, until 1 can finish off this web ... so my weaving won't all fray and come to nothing. This is a shroud for old lord Laertes, for that day when the deadly fate that lays us out at last will take him down. 1 dread the shame my countrywomen would heap upon me, yes, if a man of such wealth should lie in state without a shroud for cover.' Her very words, and despite our pride and passion we believed her. So by day she'd weave at her great and growing web — by night, by the light of torches set beside her, she would unravel all she'd done. Three whole years she deceived us blind, seduced us with this scheme ... Then, when the wheeling seasons brought the fourth year on, one of her women, in on the queen's secret, told the truth and we caught her in the act — unweaving her gorgeous web. So she finished it off. Against her will. We forced her. Now Telemachus, here is how the suitors answer you — you burn it in your mind, you and all our people: send your mother back! Direct her to marry whomever her father picks, whoever pleases her. So long as she persists in tormenting us, quick to exploit the gifts Athena gave her — a skilled hand for elegant work, a fine mind and subtle wiles too — we've never heard the like, not even in old stories sung of all Achaea's well-coifed queens who graced the years gone by: Mycenae crowned with garlands. Tyro and Alcmena ... Not one could touch Penelope for intrigue, but in this case she intrigued beyond all limits. So, we will devour your worldly goods and wealth as long as sAf holds out, holds to that course the gods have charted deep inside her heart. Great renown she wins for herself, no doubt, great loss for you in treasure. We'll not go back to our old estates or leave for other parts, not till she weds the Argive man she fancies." But with calm good sense Telemachus replied: "Antinous, how can 1 drive my mother from our house against her will, the one who bore me, reared me too? My father is worlds away, dead or alive, who knows? Imagine the high price I'd have to pay Icarius if all on my own 1 send my mother home. Oh what 1 would suffer from her father — and some dark god would hurt me even more when mother, leaving her own house behind, calls down her withering Furies on my head, and our people's cries of shame would hound my heels. 1 will never issue that ultimatum to my mother. And you, if you have any shame in your own hearts, you must leave my palace! See to your feasting elsewhere, devour your own possessions, house to house by turns. But if you decide the fare is better, richer here, destroying one man's goods and going scot-free, all right then, carve away! But I'll cry out to the everlasting gods in hopes that Zeus will pay you back with a vengeance — all of you destroyed in my house while /go scot-free myself!" And to seal his prayer, farseeing Zeus sent down a sign. He launched two eagles soaring high from a mountain ridge and down they glided, borne on the wind's draft a moment, wing to wingtip, pinions straining taut till just above the assembly's throbbing hum they whirled, suddenly, wings thrashing, wild onslaught of wings and banking down at the crowd's heads — a glaring, fatal sign — talons slashing each other, tearing cheeks and throats they swooped away on the right through homes and city. All were dumbstruck, watching the eagles trail from sight, people brooding, deeply, what might come to pass ... Until the old warrior Halitherses, Master's son, broke the silence for them: the one who outperformed all men of his time at reading bird-signs, sounding out the omens, rose and spoke, distraught for each man there: "Hear me, men of Ithaca! Hear what 1 have to say, though my revelations strike the suitors first of all — a great disaster is rolling like a breaker toward their heads. Clearly Odysseus won't be far from loved ones any longer — now, right now, he's somewhere near, 1 tell you, breeding bloody death for all these suitors here, pains aplenty too for the rest of us who live in Ithaca's sunlit air. Long before that, we must put heads together, find some way to stop these men, or let them stop themselves. Better for them that way, by far. 1 myself am no stranger to prophecy — 1 can see it now! Odysseus ... all is working out for him, 1 say, just as 1 said it would that day the Argives sailed for Troy and the mastermind of battle boarded with them. 1 said then: after many blows, and all his shipmates lost, after twenty years had wheeled by, he would come home. unrecognized by all ... and now, look, it all comes to pass!" "Stop, old man!" Eurymachus, Polybus' son, rose up to take him on. "Go home and babble your omens to your children — save tJiem from some catastrophe coming soon. I'm a better hand than you at reading portents. Flocks of birds go fluttering under the sun's rays, not all are fraught with meaning. Odysseus? He's dead now, far from home — would to god that you'd died with him too. We'd have escaped your droning prophecies then and the way you've loosed the dogs of this boy's anger — your eyes peeled for a house-gift he might give you. Here's /72f/ prophecy, bound to come to pass. If you, you old codger, wise as the ages, talk him round, incite the boy to riot, he'll be the first to suffer, let me tell you. And you, old man, we'll clap some fine on you you'll weep to pay, a fine to crush your spirit! Telemachus? Here in front of you all, here's my advice for Ajm. Let him urge his mother back to her father's house — her kin will arrange the wedding, provide the gifts, the array that goes with a daughter dearly loved. Not till then, I'd say, will the island princes quit their taxing courtship. Who's there to fear? 1 ask you. Surely not Telemachus, with all his tiresome threats. Nor do we balk, old man, at the prophecies you mouth — they'll come to grief, they'll make us hate you more. The prince's wealth will be devoured as always, mercilessly — no reparations, ever ... not while the queen drags out our hopes to wed her, waiting, day after day, all of us striving hard to win one matchless beauty. Never courting others, bevies of brides who'd suit each noble here." Telemachus answered, firm in his resolve: "Eurymachus — the rest of you fine, brazen suitors — I have done with appeals to you about these matters. I'll say no more. The gods know how things stand and so do all the Achaeans. And now all 1 ask is a good swift ship and a crew of twenty men to speed me through my passage out and back. I'm sailing off to Sparta, sandy Pylos too, for news of my long-lost father's journey home. Someone may tell me something or 1 may catch a rumor straight from Zeus, rumor that carries news to men like nothing else. Now, if 1 hear my father's alive and heading home, hard-pressed as 1 am, I'll brave out one more year. If 1 hear he's dead, no longer among the living, then back I'll come to the native land 1 love, raise his grave-mound, build his honors high with the full funeral rites that he deserves — and give my mother to another husband." A declaration, and the prince sat down as Mentor took the floor, Odysseus' friend-in-arms to whom the king, sailing off to Troy, committed his household, ordering one and all to obey the old man and he would keep things steadfast and secure. With deep concern for the realm, he rose and warned, "Hear me, men of Ithaca. Hear what 1 have to say. Never let any sceptered king be kind and gentle now, not with all his heart, or set his mind on justice — no, let him be cruel and always practice outrage. Think: not one of the people whom he ruled remembers Odysseus now, that godlike man, and kindly as a father to his children! 1 don't grudge these arrogant suitors for a moment, weaving their violent work with all their wicked hearts — they lay their lives on the line when they consume Odysseus' worldly goods, blind in their violence, telling themselves that he'll come home no more. But all the rest of you, how you rouse my fury! Sitting here in silence ... never a word put forth to curb these suitors, paltry few as they are and you so many." "Mentor!" Euenor 's son Leocritus rounded on him, shouting, "Rabble-rousing fool, now what's this talk? Goading them on to try and hold us back! It's uphill work, 1 warn you, fighting a force like ours — for just a meal. Even if Odysseus of Ithaca did arrive in person, to find us well-bred suitors feasting in his halls, and the man were hell-bent on routing us from the palace — little joy would his wife derive from his return, for all her yearning. Here on the spot he'd meet a humiliating end if he fought against such odds. You're talking nonsense — idiocy. No more. Come, dissolve the assembly. Each man return to his holdings. Mentor and Halitherses can speed our young prince on, his father's doddering friends since time began. He'll sit tight a good long while, 1 trust, scrabbling for news right here in Ithaca — he'll never make that trip." This broke up the assembly, keen to leave. The people scattered quickly, each to his own house, while the suitors strolled back to King Odysseus' palace. Telemachus, walking the beach now, far from others, washed his hands in the foaming surf and prayed to Pallas: "Dear god, hear me! Yesterday you came to my house, you told me to ship out on the misty sea and learn if father, gone so long, is ever coming home ... Look how my countrymen — the suitors most of all, the pernicious bullies — foil each move 1 make." Athena came to his prayer from close at hand, for all the world with Mentor's build and voice. and she urged him on with winging words: "Telemachus, you'll lack neither courage nor sense from this day on, not if your father's spirit courses through your veins — now there was a man, I'd say, in words and action both! So how can your journey end in shipwreck or defeat? Only if you were not his stock, Penelope's too, then I'd fear your hopes might come to grief. Few sons are the equals of their fathers; most fall short, all too few surpass them. But you, brave and adept from this day on — Odysseus' cunning has hardly given out in you — there's every hope that you will reach your goal. Put them out of your mind, these suitors' schemes and plots. They 're madmen. Not a shred of sense or decency in the crowd. Nor can they glimpse the death and black doom hovering just at their heads to crush them all in one short day. But you, the journey that stirs you now is not far off, not with the likes of me, your father's friend and yours, to rig you a swift ship and be your shipmate too. Now home you go and mix with the suitors there. But get your rations ready, pack them all in vessels, the wine in jars, and barley -meal — ^the marrow of men's bones — in durable skins, while 1 make rounds in town and quickly enlist your crew of volunteers. Lots of ships in seagirt Ithaca, old and new. I'll look them over, choose the best in sight, we'll fit her out and launch her into the sea at once!" And so Athena, daughter of Zeus, assured him. No lingering now — he heard the goddess' voice — but back he went to his house with aching heart and there at the palace found the brazen suitors skinning goats in the courtyard, singeing pigs for roasting. Antinous, smiling warmly, sauntered up to the prince, grasped his hand and coaxed him, savoring his name: "Telemachus, my high and mighty, fierce young friend, no more nursing those violent words and actions now. Come, eat and drink with us, just like the old days. Whatever you want our people will provide. A ship and a picked crew to speed you to holy Pylos, out for the news about your noble father." But self-possessed Telemachus drew the line: "Antinous, now how could 1 dine with you in peace and take my pleasure? You ruffians carousing here! Isn't it quite enough that you, my mother's suitors, have ravaged it all, my very best, these many years, while 1 was still a boy? But now that I'm full-grown and can hear the truth from others, absorb it too — now, yes, that the anger seethes inside me ... I'll stop at nothing to hurl destruction at your heads, whether 1 go to Pylos or sit tight here at home. But the trip 1 speak of will not end in failure. Go 1 will, as a passenger, nothing more, since 1 don't seem to command my own crew. That, I'm sure, is the way that suits you best. " With this he nonchalantly drew his hand from Antinous' hand while the suitors, busy feasting in the halls, mocked and taunted him, flinging insults now. "God help us," one young buck kept shouting, "he wants to slaughter us all! He's off to sandy Pylos to hire cutthroats, even Sparta perhaps, so hot to have our heads. Why, he'd rove as far as Ephyra's dark rich soil and run back home with lethal poison, slip it into the bowl and wipe us out with drink!" "Who knows?" another young blade up and ventured. "Off in that hollow ship of his, he just might drown, far from his friends, a drifter like his father. What a bore! He'd double our work for us, splitting up his goods, parceling out his house to his mother and the man who weds the queen." So they scoffed but Telemachus headed down to his father's storeroom, broad and vaulted, piled high with gold and bronze, chests packed with clothing, vats of redolent oil. And there, standing in close ranks against the wall, were jars of seasoned, mellow wine, holding the drink unmixed inside them, fit for a god, waiting the day Odysseus, worn by hardships, might come home again. Doors, snugly fitted, doubly hung, were bolted shut and a housekeeper was in charge by night and day — her care, her vigilance, guarding all those treasures — Eurycleia the daughter of Ops, Pisenor's son. Telemachus called her into the storeroom: "Come, nurse, draw me off some wine in smaller traveling jars, mellow, the finest vintage you've been keeping, next to what you reserve for our unlucky king — in case Odysseus might drop in from the blue and cheat the deadly spirits, make it home. Fill me an even dozen, seal them tightly. Pour me barley in well-stitched leather bags, twenty measures of meal, your stone-ground best. But no one else must know. These rations now, put them all together. I'll pick them up myself, toward evening, just about the time that mother climbs to her room and thinks of turning in. I'm sailing off to Sparta, sandy Pylos too, for news of my dear father's journey home. Perhaps I'll catch some rumor." A wail of grief — and his fond old nurse burst out in protest, sobbing: "Why, dear child, what craziness got into your head? Why bent on rambling over the face of the earth? — a darling only son! Your father's worlds away, god's own Odysseus, dead in some strange land. And these brutes here, just wait, the moment you're gone they'll all be scheming against you. Kill you by guile, they will, and carve your birthright up in pieces. No, sit tight here, guard your own things here. Don't go roving over the barren salt sea — no need to suffer so!" "Courage, old woman, " thoughtful Telemachus tried to reassure her, "there's a god who made this plan. But swear you won't say anything to my mother. Not till ten or a dozen days have passed or she misses me herself and learns I'm gone. She mustn't mar her lovely face with tears." The old one swore a solemn oath to the gods and vowing she would never breathe a word, quickly drew off wine in two-eared jars and poured barley in well-stitched leather bags. Telemachus returned to the hall and joined the suitors. Then bright-eyed Pallas thought of one more step. Disguised as the prince, the goddess roamed through town, pausing beside each likely crewman, giving orders: "Gather beside our ship at nightfall — be there." She asked Noemon, Phronius' generous son, to lend her a swift ship. He gladly volunteered. The sun sank and the roads of the world grew dark. Now the goddess hauled the swift ship down to the water, stowed in her all the tackle well-rigged vessels carry, moored her well away at the harbor's very mouth and once the crew had gathered, rallying round, she heartened every man. Then bright-eyed Pallas thought of one last thing. Back she went to King Odysseus' halls and there she showered sweet oblivion over the suitors, dazing them as they drank, knocking cups from hands. No more loitering now, their eyes weighed down with sleep, they rose and groped through town to find their beds. But calling the prince outside his timbered halls, taking the build and voice of Mentor once again, flashing-eyed Athena urged him on: "Telemachus, your comrades-at-arms are ready at the oars, waiting for your command to launch. So come, on with our voyage now, we're wasting time." And Pallas Athena sped away in the lead as he followed in her footsteps, man and goddess. Once they reached the ship at the water 's edge they found their long-haired shipmates on the beach. The prince, inspired, gave his first commands: "Come, friends, get the rations aboard! They 're piled in the palace now. My mother knows nothing of this. No servants either. Only one has heard our plan. " He led them back and the men fell in and fetched down all the stores and stowed them briskly, deep in the well-ribbed holds as Odysseus' son directed. Telemachus climbed aboard. Athena led the way, assuming the pilot's seat reserved astern, and he sat close beside her. Cables cast off, the crew swung to the oarlocks. Bright-eyed Athena sent them a stiff following wind rippling out of the west, ruffling over the wine-dark sea as Telemachus shouted out commands to all his shipmates: "All lay hands to tackle!" They sprang to orders, hoisting the pinewood mast, they stepped it firm in its block amidships, lashed it fast with stays and with braided rawhide halyards hauled the white sail high. Suddenly wind hit full and the canvas bellied out and a dark blue wave, foaming up at the bow, sang out loud and strong as the ship made way, skimming the whitecaps, cutting toward her goal. All running gear secure in the swift black craft, they set up bowls and brimmed them high with wine and poured libations out to the everlasting gods who never die — ^to Athena first of all, the daughter of Zeus with flashing sea-gray eyes — and the ship went plunging all night long and through the dawn. King Nestor Remembers As the sun sprang up, leaving the brilliant waters in its wake, climbing the bronze sky to shower light on immortal gods and mortal men across the plowlands ripe with grain — the ship pulled into Pglos, Neleus' storied citadel, where the people lined the beaches, sacrificing sleek black bulls to Poseidon, god of the sea-blue mane who shakes the earth. They sat in nine divisions, each five hundred strong, each division offering up nine bulls, and while the people tasted the innards, burned the thighbones for the god, the craft and crew came heading straight to shore. Striking sail, furling it in the balanced ship, they moored her well and men swung down on land. Telemachus climbed out last, Athena far in front and the bright-eyed goddess urged the prince along: "Telemachus, no more shyness, this is not the time! We sailed the seas for this, for news of your father — where does he he buried? what fate did he meet? So go right up to Nestor, breaker of horses. We'll make him yield the secrets of his heart. Press him yourself to tell the whole truth: he'll never lie — the man is far too wise." The prince replied, wise in his own way too, "How can 1 greet him. Mentor, even approach the king? I'm hardly adept at subtle conversation. Someone my age mightteeX shy, what's more, interrogating an older man. " "Telemachus," the bright-eyed goddess Athena reassured him, "some of the words you'll find within yourself, the rest some power will inspire you to say. You least of all — 1 know — were born and reared without the gods' good will." And Pallas Athena sped away in the lead as he followed in her footsteps — man and goddess gained the place where the Pylians met and massed. There sat Nestor among his sons as friends around them decked the banquet, roasted meats and skewered strips for broiling. As soon as they saw the strangers, all came crowding down, waving them on in welcome, urging them to sit. Nestor's son Pisistratus, first to reach them, grasped their hands and sat them down at the feast on fleecy throws spread out along the sandbanks, flanking his brother Thrasymedes and his father. He gave them a share of innards, poured some wine in a golden cup and, lifting it warmly toward Athena, daughter of Zeus whose shield is storm and thunder, greeted the goddess now with an invitation: "Say a prayer to lord Poseidon, stranger, hisis the feast you've found on your arrival. But once you've made your libation and your prayer — all according to ancient custom — hand this cup of hearty, seasoned wine to your comrade here so he can pour forth too. He too, 1 think, should pray to the deathless ones himself. All men need the gods ... but the man is younger, just about my age. That's why 1 give the gold cup first to you." With that Pisistratus placed in her hand the cup of mellow wine and Pallas rejoiced at the prince's sense of tact in giving the golden winecup first to her. At once she prayed intensely to Poseidon: "Hear me. Sea-lord, you who embrace the earth — don't deny our wishes, bring our prayers to pass! First, then, to Nestor and all his sons grant glory. Then to all these Pylians, for their splendid rites grant a reward that warms their gracious hearts. Last, Poseidon, grant Telemachus and myself safe passage home, the mission accomplished that sped us here in our rapid black ship. " So she prayed, and brought it all to pass. She offered the rich two-handled cup to Telemachus, Odysseus' son, who echoed back her prayer word for word. They roasted the prime cuts, pulled them off the spits and sharing out the portions, fell to the royal feast. Once they'd put aside desire for food and drink, old Nestor the noble charioteer began, at last: "Now's the time, now they've enjoyed their meal, to probe our guests and find out who they are. Strangers — friends, who are you? Where did you sail from, over the running sea-lanes? Out on a trading spree or roving the waves like pirates, sea-wolves raiding at will, who risk their lives to plunder other men?" Poised Telemachus answered, filled with heart, the heart Athena herself inspired, to ask for the news about his father, gone so long. and make his name throughout the mortal world. "Nestor, son of Neleus, Achaea's pride and glory — where are we from, you ask? 1 will tell you all. We hail from Ithaca, under the heights of Nion. Our mission here is personal, nothing public now. 1 am on the trail of my father's widespread fame, you see, searching the earth to catch some news of great-hearted King Odysseus who, they say, fought with you to demolish Troy some years ago. About all the rest who fought the Trojans there, we know where each one died his wretched death, but father ... even his death — the son of Cronus shrouds it all in mystery. No one can say for certain where he died, whether he went down on land at enemy hands or out on the open sea in Amphitrite's breakers. That's why I've come to plead before you now, if you can tell me about his cruel death: perhaps you saw him die with your own eyes or heard the wanderer's end from someone else. More than all other men, that man was born for pain. Don't soften a thing, from pity, respect for me — tell me, clearly, all your eyes have witnessed. 1 beg you — if ever my father, lord Odysseus, pledged you his word and made it good in action once on the fields of Troy where you Achaeans suffered, remember his story now, tell me the truth." Nestor the noble charioteer replied at length: "Ah dear boy, since you call back such memories, such living hell we endured in distant Troy — we headstrong fighting forces of Achaea — so many raids from shipboard down the foggy sea, cruising for plunder, wherever Achilles led the way; so many battles round King Priam's walls we fought, so many gone, our best and bravest fell. There Ajax lies, the great man of war. There lies Achilles too. There Patroclus, skilled as the gods in counsel. And there my own dear son, both strong and staunch, Antilochus — lightning on his feet and every inch a fighter! But so many other things we suffered, past that count — what mortal in this wide world could tell it all? Not if you sat and probed his memory, five, six years, delving for all the pains our brave Achaeans bore there. Your patience would fray, you'd soon head for home ... Nine years we wove a web of disaster for those Trojans, pressing them hard with every tactic known to man, and only after we slaved did Zeus award us victory. And no one there could hope to rival Odysseus, not for sheer cunning — at every twist of strategy he excelled us all. Your father, yes, if you are in fact his son ... 1 look at you and a sense of wonder takes me. Your way with words — it's just like his — I'd swear no youngster could ever speak like you, so apt, so telling. As long as 1 and great Odysseus soldiered there, never once did we speak out at odds, neither in open muster nor in royal council: forever one in mind, in judgment balanced, shrewd, we mapped our armies' plans so things might turn out best. But then, once we'd sacked King Priam's craggy city, Zeus contrived in his heart a fatal homeward run for all the Achaeans who were fools, at least, dishonest too, so many met a disastrous end, thanks to the lethal rage of the mighty Father's daughter. Eyes afire, Athena set them feuding, Atreus' two sons ... They summoned all the Achaean ranks to muster, rashly , just at sunset — no hour to rally troops — and in they straggled, sodden with wine, our heroes. The brothers harangued them, told them why they'd met: a crisis — Menelaus urging the men to fix their minds on the voyage home across the sea's broad back, but it brought no joy to Agamemnon, not at all. meant to detain us there and offer victims, anything to appease Athena's dreadful wrath — poor fool, he never dreamed Athena would not comply. The minds of the everlasting gods don't change so quickly. So the two of them stood there, wrangling, back and forth till the armies sprang up, their armor clashing, ungodly uproar — two plans split the ranks. That night we barely slept, seething with hard feelings against our own comrades, for Zeus was brooding over us, poised to seal our doom ... At dawn, half of us hauled our vessels down to sea, we stowed our plunder, our sashed and lovely women. But half the men held back, camped on the beach, waiting it out for Agamemnon's next commands while our contingent embarked — we pushed off and sailed at a fast clip as a god smoothed out the huge troughing swells. We reached Tenedos quickly, sacrificed to the gods, the crews keen for home, but a quick return was not in Zeus's plans, not yet: that cruel power loosed a cursed feud on us once again. Some swung their rolling warships hard about — Odysseus sailed them back, the flexible, wily king, veering over to Agamemnon now to shore his fortunes up. Not 1. Massing the ships that came in my flotilla, /sped away as the god's mischief kept on brewing, dawning on me now. And Tydeus' fighting son Diomedes fled too, rousing all his comrades. Late in the day the red-haired Menelaus joined us, overtook us at Lesbos, debating the long route home: whether to head north, over the top of rocky Chios, skirting Psy rie, keeping that island off to port or run south of Chios, by Mimas' gusty cape. We asked the god for a sign. He showed us one, he urged us to cut out on the middle passage, straight to Euboea now, escape a catastrophe, fast as we could sail! A shrilling wind came up, stiff, driving us on and on we raced, over the sea-lanes rife with fish and we made Geraestus Point in the dead of night. Many thighs of bulls we offered Poseidon there — thank god we'd crossed that endless reach of sea. Then on the fourth day out the crews of Diomedes, breaker of horses, moored their balanced ships at Argos port, but 1 held course for Pylos, yes, and never once did the good strong wind go limp from the first day the god unleashed its blast. And so, dear boy, 1 made it home from Troy, in total ignorance, knowing nothing of their fates, the ones who stayed behind: who escaped with their lives and who went down. But all I've gathered by hearsay, sitting here in my own house — that you'll learn, it's only right, I'll hide nothing now. They say the Myrmidons, those savage spearmen led by the shining son of lionhearted Achilles, traveled home unharmed. Philoctetes the gallant son of Poias, safe as well. Idomeneus brought his whole contingent back to Crete, all who'd escaped the war — ^the sea snatched none from him. But Atreus' son Agamemnon ... you yourselves, even in far-off Ithaca, must have heard how he returned, how Aegisthus hatched the king's horrendous death. But what a price Aepaid, in blood, in suffering. Ah how fine it is, when a man is brought down, to leave a son behind! Orestes took revenge, he killed that cunning, murderous Aegisthus, who'd killed his famous father. And you, my friend — how tall and handsome 1 see you now — be brave, you too, so men to come will sing your praises down the years." Telemachus, weighing the challenge closely, answered, "Oh Nestor, son of Neleus, Achaea's pride and glory. what a stroke of revenge that was! All Achaeans will spread Orestes' fame across the world, a song for those to come. If only the gods would arm me in such power I'd take revenge on the lawless, brazen suitors riding roughshod over me, plotting reckless outrage. But for meihe gods have spun out no such joy , for my father or myself. 1 must bear up, that's all." And the old charioteer replied, "Now that you mention it, dear boy, 1 do recall a mob of suitors, they say, besets your mother there in your own house, against your will, and plots your ruin. Tell me, though, do you /e/^yourself be so abused, or do people round about, stirred up by the prompting of some god, despise you now? Who knows if he^Ni\\ return someday to take revenge on all their violence? Single-handed perhaps or with an Argive army at his back? If only the bright-eyed goddess chose to love you just as she lavished care on brave Odysseus, years ago in the land of Troy, where we Achaeans struggled! I've never seen the immortals show so much affection as Pallas openly showed AJm, standing by your father — if only she'd favor you, tend youyNith all her heart, many a suitor then would lose all thought of marriage, blotted out forever." "Never, your majesty," Telemachus countered gravely, "that will never come to pass, 1 know. What you say dumbfounds me, staggers imagination! Hope, hope as 1 will, that day will never dawn ... not even if the gods should will it so." "Telemachus!" Pallas Athena broke in sharply, her eyes afire — "What's this nonsense slipping through your teeth? It's light work for a willing god to save a mortal even half the world away. Myself, I'd rather sail through years of trouble and labor home and see that blessed day, than hurry home to die at my own hearth like Agamemnon, killed by Aegisthus' cunning — by his own wife. But the great leveler. Death: not even the gods can defend a man, not even one they love, that day when fate takes hold and lays him out at last." "Mentor," wise Telemachus said, "distraught as we are for him, let's speak of this no more. My father's return? It's inconceivable now. Long ago the undying gods have sealed his death, his black doom. But now there's another question 1 would put to Nestor: Nestor excels all men for sense and justice, his knowledge of the world. Three generations he has ruled, they say, and to my young eyes he seems a deathless god! Nestor, son of Neleus, tell me the whole story — how did the great king Agamemnon meet his death? Where was Menelaus? What fatal trap did he set, that treacherous Aegisthus, to bring down a man far stronger than himself? Was Menelaus gone from Achaean Argos, roving the world somewhere, so the coward found the nerve to kill the king?" And old Nestor the noble charioteer replied: "Gladly, my boy, I'll tell you the story first to last ... Right you are, you guess what would have happened if red-haired Menelaus, arriving back from Troy, had found Aegisthus alive in Agamemnon's palace. No barrow piled high on the earth for JiJs dead body, no, the dogs and birds would have feasted on his corpse, sprawled on the plain outside the city gates, and no one, no woman in all Achaea, would have wept a moment, such a monstrous crime the man contrived! But there we were, camped at Troy, battling out the long hard campaign while he at his ease at home, in the depths of Argos, stallion-country — he lay siege to the wife of Agamemnon, luring, enticing her with talk. At first, true, she spurned the idea of such an outrage, Cly temnestra the queen, her will was faithful still. And there was a man, what's more, a bard close by, to whom Agamemnon, setting sail for Troy, gave strict commands to guard his wife. But then, that day the doom of the gods had bound her to surrender, Aegisthus shipped the bard away to a desert island, marooned him there, sweet prize for the birds of prey, and swept her off to his own house, lover lusting for lover. And many thighbones he burned on the gods' holy altars, many gifts he hung on the temple walls — gold, brocades — in thanks for a conquest past his maddest hopes. Now we, you see, were sailing home from Troy in the same squadron, Menelaus and 1, comrades-in-arms from years of war. But as we rounded holy Sounion, Athens' headland, lord Apollo attacked Atrides' helmsman, aye, with his gentle shafts he shot the man to death — an iron grip on the tiller, the craft scudding fast — Phrontis, Onetor's son, who excelled all men alive at steering ships when gales bore down in fury. So Menelaus, straining to sail on, was held back till he could bury his mate with fitting rites. But once he'd got off too, plowing the wine-dark sea in his ribbed ships, and made a run to Malea's beetling cape, farseeing Zeus decided to give the man rough sailing, poured a hurricane down upon him, shrilling winds, giant, rearing whitecaps, monstrous, mountains high. There at a stroke he cut the fleet in half and drove one wing to Crete, where Cydonians make their homes along the lardanus River. Now, there's a sheer cliff plunging steep to the surf at the farthest edge of Gorty n, out on the mist-bound sea, where the South Wind piles breakers, huge ones, left of the headland's horn, toward Phaestos, with only a low reef to block the crushing tides. In they sailed, and barely escaped their death — the ships' crews, that is — the rollers smashed their hulls against the rocks. But as for the other five with pitch-black prows, the wind and current swept them on toward Egypt. So Menelaus, amassing a hoard of stores and gold, was off cruising his ships to foreign ports of call while Aegisthus hatched his vicious work at home. Seven years he lorded over Mycenae rich in gold, once he'd killed Agamemnon — he ground the people down. But the eighth year ushered in his ruin. Prince Orestes home from Athens, yes, he cut him down, that cunning, murderous Aegisthus, who'd killed his famous father. Vengeance done, he held a feast for the Argives, to bury his hated mother, craven Aegisthus too, the very day Menelaus arrived, lord of the war cry , freighted with all the wealth his ships could carry. So you, dear boy, take care. Don't rove from home too long, too far, leaving your own holdings unprotected — crowds in your palace so brazen they'll carve up all your wealth, devour it all, and then your journey here will come to nothing. Still 1 advise you, urge you to visit Menelaus. He's back from abroad at last, from people so removed you might abandon hope of ever returning home, once the winds had driven you that far off course, into a sea so vast not even cranes could wing their way in one year's flight — so vast it is, so awesome ... So, off you go with your ships and shipmates now. Or if you'd rather go by land, there's team and chariot, my sons at your service too, and they'll escort you to sunny Lacedaemon, home of the red-haired king. Press him yourself to tell the whole truth: he'll never lie — the man is far too wise." So he closed as the sun set and darkness swept across the earth and the bright-eyed goddess Pallas spoke for all: "There was a tale, old soldier, so well told. Come, cut out the victims' tongues and mix the wine, so once we've poured libations out to the Sea-lord and every other god, we'll think of sleep. High time — the light's already sunk in the western shadows. It's wrong to linger long at the gods' feast; we must be on our way." Zeus's daughter — they all hung closely on every word she said. Heralds sprinkled water over their hands for rinsing, the young men brimmed the mixing bowls with wine, they tipped first drops for the god in every cup, then poured full rounds for all. They rose and flung the victims' tongues on the fire and poured libations out. When they'd poured, and drunk to their hearts' content, Athena and Prince Telemachus both started up to head for their ship at once. But Nestor held them there, objecting strongly: "Zeus forbid — and the other deathless gods as well — that you resort to your ship and put my house behind like a rank pauper's without a stitch of clothing, no piles of rugs, no blankets in his place for host and guests to slumber soft in comfort. Why, I've plenty of fine rugs and blankets here- No, by god, the true son of my good friend Odysseus won't bed down on a ship's deck, not while I'm alive or my sons are left at home to host our guests, whoever comes to our palace, newfound friends." "Dear old man, you're right," Athena exclaimed, her eyes brightening now. "Telemachus should oblige you. Much the better way. Let him follow you now, sleep in your halls, but I'll go back to our trim black ship. hearten the crew and give each man his orders. I'm the only veteran in their ranks, I tell you. All the rest, of an age with brave Telemachus, are younger men who sailed with him as friends. I'll bed down there by the dark hull tonight, at dawn push off for the proud Cauconians. Those people owe me a debt long overdue, and no mean sum, believe me. But you, seeing my friend is now your guest, speed him on his way with a chariot and your son and give him the finest horses that you have, bred for stamina, trained to race the wind." With that the bright-eyed goddess winged away in an eagle's form and flight. Amazement fell on all the Achaeans there. The old king, astonished by what he'd seen, grasped Telemachus' hand and cried out to the prince, "Dear boy — never fear you'll be a coward or defenseless, not if at your young age the gods will guard you so. Of all who dwell on Olympus, this was none but she, Zeus's daughter, the glorious one, his third born, who prized your gallant father among the Argives. Now, 0 Queen, be gracious! Give us high renown, myself, my children, my loyal wife and queen. 1 will make you a sacrifice, a yearling heifer broad in the brow, unbroken, never yoked by men. I'll offer it up to you — I'll sheathe its horns in gold." So he prayed, and Pallas Athena heard his prayer. And Nestor the noble chariot-driver led them on, his sons and sons-in-law, back to his regal palace. Once they reached the storied halls of the aged king they sat on rows of low and high-backed chairs. As they arrived the old man mixed them all a bowl, stirring the hearty wine, seasoned eleven years before a servant broached it, loosed its seal. Mulling it in the bowl, old Nestor poured a libation out, praying hard to Pallas Athena, daughter of Zeus whose shield is storm and thunder. Once they had poured their offerings, drunk their fill, the Pylians went to rest, each in his own house. But the noble chariot-driver let Telemachus, King Odysseus' son, sleep at the palace now, on a corded bed inside the echoing colonnade, with Prince Pisistratus there beside him, the young spearman, already captain of armies, though the last son still unwed within the halls. The king retired to chambers deep in his lofty house where the queen his wife arranged and shared their bed. When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more old Nestor the noble chariot-driver climbed from bed, went out and took his seat on the polished stones, a bench glistening white, rubbed with glossy oil, placed for the king before his looming doors. There Neleus held his sessions years ago, a match for the gods in counsel, but his fate had long since forced him down to Death. Now royal Nestor in turn, Achaea's watch and ward, sat there holding the scepter while his sons, coming out of their chambers, clustered round him, hovering near: Echephron, Stratius, Perseus and Aretus, Thrasymedes like a god, and sixth, young lord Pisistratus came to join their ranks. They escorted Prince Telemachus in to sit beside them. Nestor, noble charioteer, began the celebration: "Quickly, my children, carry out my wishes now so 1 may please the gods, Athena first of all — she came to me at Poseidon's flowing feast, Athena in all her glory! Now someone go to the fields to fetch a heifer, lead her here at once — a herdsman drive her in. Someone hurry down to Prince Telemachus' black ship. bring up all his crewmen, leave just two behind. And another tell our goldsmith, skilled Laerces, to come and sheathe the heifer's horns in gold. The rest stay here together. Tell the maids inside the hall to prepare a sumptuous feast — bring seats and firewood, bring pure water too." They all pitched in to carry out his orders. The heifer came from the fields, the crewmen came from brave Telemachus' ship, and the smith came in with all his gear in hand, the tools of his trade, the anvil, hammer and well-wrought tongs he used for working gold. And Athena came as well to attend her sacred rites. The old horseman passed the gold to the smith, and twining the foil, he sheathed the heifer's horns so the goddess' eyes might dazzle, delighted with the gift. Next Stratius and Echephron led the beast by the horns. Aretus, coming up from the storeroom, brought them lustral water filling a flower-braided bowl, in his other hand, the barley in a basket. Thrasymedes, staunch in combat, stood ready, whetted ax in his grasp to cut the heifer down, and Perseus held the basin for the blood. Now Nestor the old charioteer began the rite. Pouring the lustral water, scattering barley-meal, he lifted up his ardent prayers to Pallas Athena, launching the sacrifice, flinging onto the fire the first tufts of hair from the victim's head. Prayers said, the scattering barley strewn, suddenly Nestor's son impetuous Thrasymedes strode up close and struck — ^the ax chopped the neck tendons through — and the blow stunned the heifer's strength — The women shrilled their cry, Nestor's daughters, sons' wives and his own loyal wife Eurydice, Clymenus' eldest daughter. Then, hoisting up the victim's head from the trampled earth, they held her fast as the captain of men Pisistratus slashed her throat. Dark blood gushed forth, life ebbed from her limbs — they quartered her quickly, cut the thighbones out and all according to custom wrapped them round in fat, a double fold sliced clean and topped with strips of flesh. And the old king burned these over dried split wood and over the fire poured out glistening wine while young men at his side held five-pronged forks. Once they 'd burned the bones and tasted the organs, they sliced the rest into pieces, spitted them on skewers and raising points to the fire, broiled all the meats. During the ritual lovely Polycaste, youngest daughter of Nestor, Neleus' son, had bathed Telemachus. Rinsing him off now, rubbing him down with oil, she drew a shirt and handsome cape around him. Out of his bath he stepped, glowing like a god, strode in and sat by the old commander Nestor. They roasted the prime cuts, pulled them off the spits and sat down to the feast while ready stewards saw to rounds of wine and kept the gold cups flowing. When they'd put aside desire for food and drink, Nestor the noble chariot-driver issued orders: "Hurry, my boys! Bring Telemachus horses, a good fuU-maned team — hitch them to a chariot — he must be off at once." They listened closely, snapped to his commands and hitched a rapid team to a chariot's yoke in haste. A housekeeper stowed some bread and wine aboard and meats too, food fit for the sons of kings. Telemachus vaulted onto the splendid chariot — right beside him Nestor's son Pisistratus, captain of armies, boarded, seized the reins, whipped the team to a run and on the horses flew. holding nothing back, out into open country, leaving the heights of Pylos fading in their trail, shaking the yoke across their shoulders all day long. The sun sank and the roads of the world grew dark as they reached Phera, pulling up to Diodes' halls, the son of Ortilochus, son of the Alpheus River. He gave them a royal welcome; there they slept the night. When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more they yoked their pair again, mounted the blazoned car and out through the gates and echoing colonnade they whipped the team to a run and on they flew, holding nothing back — and the princes reached the wheatlands, straining now for journey's end, so fast those purebred stallions raced them on as the sun sank and the roads of the world grew dark. The King and Queen of Sparta At last they gained the ravines of Lacedaemon ringed by hills and drove up to the halls of Menelaus in his glory. They found the king inside his palace, celebrating with throngs of kinsmen a double wedding-feast for his son and lovely daughter. The princess he was sending on to the son of great Achilles, breaker of armies. Years ago Menelaus vowed, he nodded assent at Troy and pledged her hand, and now the gods were sealing firm the marriage. So he was sending her on her way with team and chariot, north to the Myrmidons' famous city governed by her groom. From Sparta he brought Alector's daughter as the bride for his own full-grown son, the hardy Megapenthes, born to him by a slave. To Helen the gods had granted no more offspring once she had borne her first child. the breathtaking Hermione, a luminous beauty gold as Aphrodite. So now they feasted within the grand, high-roofed palace, all the kin and clansmen of Menelaus in his glory, reveling warmly here as in their midst an inspired bard sang out and struck his lyre — and through them a pair of tumblers dashed and sprang, whirling in leaping handsprings, leading on the dance. The travelers, Nestor's shining son and Prince Telemachus, had brought themselves and their horses to a standstill just outside the court when good lord Eteoneus, passing through the gates now, saw them there, and the ready aide-in-arms of Menelaus took the message through his sovereign's halls and stepping close to his master broke the news: "Strangers have just arrived, your majesty, Menelaus. Two men, but they look like kin of mighty Zeus himself. Tell me, should we unhitch their team for them or send them to someone free to host them well?" The red-haired king took great offense at that: "Never a fool before, Eteoneus, son of Boethous, now 1 see you're babbling like a child! Just think of all the hospitality ivie enjoyed at the hands of other men before we made it home, and god save us from such hard treks in years to come. Quick, unhitch their team. And bring them in, strangers, guests, to share our flowing feast." Back through the halls he hurried, calling out to other brisk attendants to follow quickly. They loosed the sweating team from under the yoke, tethered them fast by reins inside the horse-stalls, tossing feed at their hoofs, white barley mixed with wheat, and canted the chariot up against the polished walls, shimmering in the sun, then ushered in their guests. into that magnificent place. Both struck by the sight, they marveled up and down the house of the warlord dear to Zeus — a radiance strong as the moon or rising sun came flooding through the high-roofed halls of illustrious Menelaus. Once they'd feasted their eyes with gazing at it all, into the burnished tubs they climbed and bathed. When women had washed them, rubbed them down with oil and drawn warm fleece and shirts around their shoulders, they took up seats of honor next to Atrides Menelaus. A maid brought water soon in a graceful golden pitcher and over a silver basin tipped it out so they might rinse their hands, then pulled a gleaming table to their side. A staid housekeeper brought on bread to serve them, appetizers aplenty too, lavish with her bounty. As a carver lifted platters of meat toward them, meats of every sort, and set before them golden cups, the red-haired king Menelaus greeted both guests warmly. "Help yourselves to food, and welcome! Once you've dined we'll ask you who you are. But your parents' blood is hardly lost in you. You must be born of kings, bred by the gods to wield the royal scepter. No mean men could sire sons like you." With those words he passed them a fat rich loin with his own hands, the choicest part, that he'd been served himself. They reached for the good things that lay outspread and when they'd put aside desire for food and drink, Telemachus, leaning his head close to Nestor's son, spoke low to the prince so no one else could hear: "Look, Pisistratus— joy of my heart, my friend — the sheen of bronze, the blaze of gold and amber, silver, ivory too, through all this echoing mansion! Surely Zeus's court on Olympus must be just like this, the boundless glory of all this wealth inside! My eyes dazzle ... 1 am struck with wonder." But the red-haired warlord overheard his guest and cut in quickly with winged words for both: "No man alive could rival Zeus, dear boys, with his everlasting palace and possessions. But among men, 1 must say, few if any could rival mein riches. Believe me, much 1 suffered, many a mile 1 roved to haul such treasures home in my ships. Eight years out, wandering off as far as Cyprus, Phoenicia, even Egypt, 1 reached the Ethiopians, Sidonians, Erembians — Libya too, where lambs no sooner spring from the womb than they grow horns. Three times in the circling year the ewes give birth. So no one, neither king nor shepherd could want for cheese or mutton, or sweet milk either, udders swell for the sucklings round the year. But while 1 roamed those lands, amassing a fortune, a stranger killed my brother, blind to the danger, duped blind — thanks to the cunning of his cursed, murderous queen! So 1 rule all this wealth with no great joy . You must have heard my story from your fathers, whoever they are — ^what hardships 1 endured, how 1 lost this handsome palace built for the ages, filled to its depths with hoards of gorgeous things. Well, would to god I'd stayed right here in my own house with a third of all that wealth and they yN ere still alive, all who died on the wide plain of Troy those years ago, far from the stallion-land of Argos. And still, much as 1 weep for all my men, grieving sorely, time and again, sitting here in the royal halls, now indulging myself in tears, now brushing tears away — the grief that numbs the spirit gluts us quickly — for none of all those comrades, pained as 1 am, do 1 grieve as much for one ... that man who makes sleep hateful, even food, as 1 pore over his memory. No one, no Achaean, labored hard as Odysseus labored or achieved so much. And how did his struggles end? In suffering for that man; for me, in relentless, heartbreaking grief for him, lost and gone so long now — dead or alive, who knows? How they must mourn him too, Laertes, the old man, and self-possessed Penelope. Telemachus as well, the boy he left a babe in arms at home." Such memories stirred in the young prince a deep desire to grieve for Odysseus. Tears streamed down his cheeks and wet the ground when he heard his father's name, both hands clutching his purple robe before his eyes. Menelaus recognized him at once but pondered deeply whether to let him state his father's name or probe him first and prompt him step by step. While he debated all this now within himself, Helen emerged from her scented, lofty chamber — striking as Artemis with her golden shafts — and a train of women followed ... Adreste drew up her carved reclining-chair, Alcippe brought a carpet of soft-piled fleece, Phylo carried her silver basket given by Alcandre, King Polybus' wife, who made his home in Egyptian Thebes where the houses overflow with the greatest troves of treasure. The king gave Menelaus a pair of bathing-tubs in silver, two tripods, ten bars of gold, and apart from these his wife presented Helen her own precious gifts: a golden spindle, a basket that ran on casters, solid silver polished off with rims of gold. Now Phylo her servant rolled it in beside her, heaped to the brim with yarn prepared for weaving; the spindle swathed in violet wool lay tipped across it. Helen leaned back in her chair, a stool beneath her feet, and pressed her husband at once for each detail: "Do we know, my lord Menelaus, who our visitors claim to be, our welcome new arrivals? Right or wrong, what can 1 say? My heart tells me to come right out and say I've never seen such a likeness, neither in man nor woman — I'm amazed at the sight. To the life he's Uke the son of great Odysseus, surely he's Telemachus! The boy that hero left a babe in arms at home when all you Achaeans fought at Troy, launching your headlong battles just for my sake, shameless whore that 1 was." "My dear, my dear," the red-haired king assured her, "now that you mention it, 1 see the Ukeness too ... Odysseus' feet were like the boy 's, his hands as well, his glancing eyes, his head, and the fine shock of hair. Yes, and just now, as 1 was talking about Odysseus, remembering how he struggled, suffered, all for me, a flood of tears came streaming down his face and he clutched his purple robe before his eyes." "Right you are" — Pisistratus stepped in quickly — "son of Atreus, King Menelaus, captain of armies: here is the son of that great hero, as you say. But the man is modest, he would be ashamed to make a show of himself, his first time here, and interrupt you. We delight in your voice as if some god were speaking! The noble horseman Nestor sent me along to be his escort. Telemachus yearned to see you, so you could give him some advice or urge some action. When a father's gone, his son takes much abuse in a house where no one comes to his defense. So with Telemachus now. His father's gone. No men at home will shield him from the worst." "Wonderful!" the red-haired king cried out. "The son of my dearest friend, here in my own house! That man who performed a hundred feats of arms for me. And 1 swore that when he came I'd give him a hero's welcome, him above all my comrades — if only Olympian Zeus, farseeing Zeus, had granted us both safe passage home across the sea in our swift trim ships. Why, I'd have settled a city in Argos for him. built him a palace, shipped him over from Ithaca, him and all his wealth, his son, his people too — emptied one of the cities nestling round about us, one I rule myself. Both fellow-countrymen then, how often we'd have mingled side-by-side! Nothing could have parted us, bound by love for each other, mutual delight ... till death's dark cloud came shrouding round us both. But god himself, jealous of all this, no doubt, robbed that unlucky man, him and him alone, of the day of his return. " So Menelaus mused and stirred in them all a deep desire to grieve. Helen of Argos, daughter of Zeus, dissolved in tears, Telemachus wept too, and so did Atreus' son Menelaus. Nor could Nestor's son Pisistratus stay dry-eyed, remembering now his gallant brother Antilochus, cut down by Memnon, splendid son of the Morning. Thinking of him, the young prince broke out: "Old Nestor always spoke of you, son of Atreus, as the wisest man of all the men he knew, whenever we talked about you there at home, questioning back and forth. So now, please, if it isn't out of place, indulge me, won't you? Myself, 1 take no joy in weeping over supper. Morning will soon bring time enough for that. Not that I'd grudge a tear for any man gone down to meet his fate. What other tribute can we pay to wretched men than to cut a lock, let tears roll down our cheeks? And 1 have a brother of my own among the dead, and hardly the poorest soldier in our ranks. You probably knew him. 1 never met him, never saw him myself. But they say he outdid our best, Antilochus — lightning on his feet and every inch a fighter!" "Well said, my friend," the red-haired king replied. "Not even an older man could speak and do as well. Your father's son you are — your words have all his wisdom. It 's easy to spot the breed of a man whom Zeus has marked for joy in birth and marriage both. Take great King Nestor now: Zeus has blessed him, all his livelong days, growing rich and sleek in his old age at home, his sons expert with spears and full of sense. Well, so much for the tears that caught us just now; let's think again of supper. Come, rinse our hands. Tomorrow, at dawn, will offer me and Telemachus time to talk and trade our thoughts in full." Asphalion quickly rinsed their hands with water, another of King Menelaus' ready aides-in arms. Again they reached for the good things set before them. Then Zeus's daughter Helen thought of something else. Into the mixing-bowl from which they drank their wine she slipped a drug, heart's-ease, dissolving anger, magic to make us all forget our pains ... No one who drank it deeply, mulled in wine, could let a tear roll down his cheeks that day, not even if his mother should die, his father die, not even if right before his eyes some enemy brought down a brother or darling son with a sharp bronze blade. So cunning the drugs that Zeus's daughter plied, potent gifts from Polydamna the wife of Thon, a woman of Egypt, land where the teeming soil bears the richest yield of herbs in all the world: many health itself when mixed in the wine, and many deadly poison. Every man is a healer there, more skilled than any other men on earth — Egyptians born of the healing god himself. So now Helen, once she had drugged the wine and ordered winecups filled, resuming the conversation, entertained the group: "My royal king Menelaus — ^welcome guests here, sons of the great as well! Zeus can present us times of joy and times of grief in turn: all lies within his power. So come, let's sit back in the palace now, dine and warm our hearts with the old stories. 1 will tell something perfect for the occasion. Surely 1 can't describe or even list them all, the exploits crowding fearless Odysseus' record, but what a feat that hero dared and carried off in the land of Troy where you Achaeans suffered! Scarring his own body with mortifying strokes, throwing filthy rags on his back like any slave, he slipped into the enemy's city, roamed its streets — all disguised, a totally different man, a beggar, hardly the figure he cut among Achaea's ships. That's how Odysseus infiltrated Troy, and no one knew him at all ... 1 alone, 1 spotted him for the man he was, kept questioning him — the crafty one kept dodging. But after I'd bathed him, rubbed him down with oil, given him clothes to wear and sworn a binding oath not to reveal him as Odysseus to the Trojans, not till he was back at his swift ships and shelters, then at last he revealed to me, step by step, the whole Achaean strategy. And once he'd cut a troop of Trojans down with his long bronze sword, back he went to his comrades, filled with information. The rest of the Trojan women shrilled their grief. Not 1: my heart leapt up — my heart had changed by now — 1 yearned to sail back home again! 1 grieved too late for the madness Aphrodite sent me, luring me there, far from my dear land, forsaking my own child, my bridal bed, my husband too, a man who lacked for neither brains nor beauty." And the red-haired Menelaus answered Helen: "There was a tale, my lady. So well told. Now then, 1 have studied, in my time. the plans and minds of great ones by the score. And I have traveled over a good part of the world but never once have 1 laid eyes on a man like him — what a heart that fearless Odysseus had inside him! What a piece of work the hero dared and carried off in the wooden horse where all our best encamped, our champions armed with bloody death for Troy ... when along you came, Helen — roused, no doubt, by a dark power bent on giving Troy some glory, and dashing Prince Deiphobus squired your every step. Three times you sauntered round our hollow ambush, feeling, stroking its flanks, challenging all our fighters, calling each by name — yours was the voice of all our long-lost wives! And Diomedes and 1, crouched tight in the midst with great Odysseus, hearing you singing out, were both keen to spring up and sally forth or give you a sudden answer from inside, but Odysseus damped our ardor, reined us back. Then all the rest of the troops kept stock-still, all but Anticlus. He was hot to salute you now but Odysseus clamped his great hands on the man's mouth and shut it, brutally — yes, he saved us all, holding on grim-set till Pallas Athena lured you off at last." But clear-sighted Telemachus ventured, "Son of Atreus, King Menelaus, captain of armies, so much the worse, for not one bit of that saved himivom grisly death ... not even a heart of iron could have helped. But come, send us off to bed. It's time to rest, time to enjoy the sweet relief of sleep." And Helen briskly told her serving-women to make beds in the porch's shelter, lay down some heavy purple throws for the beds themselves, and over them spread some blankets, thick woolly robes. a warm covering laid on top. Torches in hand, they left the hall and made up beds at once. The herald led the two guests on and so they slept outside the palace under the forecourt's colonnade, young Prince Telemachus and Nestor's shining son. Menelaus retired to chambers deep in his lofty house with Helen the pearl of women loosely gowned beside him. When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more the lord of the warcry climbed from bed and dressed, over his shoulder he slung his well-honed sword, fastened rawhide sandals under his smooth feet, stepped from his bedroom, handsome as a god, and sat beside Telemachus, asking, kindly, "Now, my young prince, tell me what brings you here to sunny Lacedaemon, sailing over the sea's broad back. A public matter or private? Tell me the truth now." And with all the poise he had, Telemachus replied, "Son of Atreus, King Menelaus, captain of armies, 1 came in the hope that you can tell me now some news about my father. My house is being devoured, my rich farms destroyed, my palace crammed with enemies, slaughtering on and on my droves of sheep and shambling longhorn cattle. Suitors plague my mother — ^the insolent, overweening ... That's why I've come to plead before you now, if you can tell me about his cruel death: perhaps you saw him die with your own eyes or heard the wanderer's end from someone else. More than all other men, that man was born for pain. Don't soften a thing, from pity, respect for me — tell me, clearly, all your eyes have witnessed. 1 beg you — if ever my father, lord Odysseus, pledged you his word and made it good in action once on the fields of Troy where you Achaeans suffered, remember his story now, tell me the truth." "How shameful!" the red-haired king burst out in anger. "That's the bed of a brave man of war they'd like to crawl inside, those spineless, craven cowards! Weak as the doe that beds down her fawns in a mighty lion's den — her newborn sucklings — then trails off to the mountain spurs and grassy bends to graze her fill, but back the lion comes to his own lair and the master deals both fawns a ghastly bloody death, just what Odysseus will deal that mob — ghastly death. Ah if only — Father Zeus, Athena and lord Apollo — that man who years ago in the games at Lesbos rose to Philomelides' challenge, wrestled him, pinned him down with one tremendous throw and the Argives roared with joy ... if only ^Aa^ Odysseus sported with those suitors, a blood wedding, a quick death would take the lot! But about the things you've asked me, so intently, I'll skew and sidestep nothing, not deceive you, ever. Of all Aftold me — the Old Man of the Sea who never lies — I'll hide or hold back nothing, not a single word. It was in Egypt, where the gods still marooned me, eager as 1 was to voyage home ... I'd failed, you see, to render them full, flawless victims, and gods are always keen to see their rules obeyed. Now, there's an island out in the ocean's heavy surge, well off the Egyptian coast — they call it Pharos — far as a deep-sea ship can go in one day's sail with a whistling wind astern to drive her on. There's a snug harbor there, good landing beach where crews pull in, draw water up from the dark wells, then push their vessels off for passage out. But here the gods becalmed me twenty days ... not a breath of the breezes ruffling out to sea that speed a ship across the ocean's broad back. Now our rations would all have been consumed, our crews' stamina too, if one of the gods had not felt sorry for me, shown me mercy. Eidothea, a daughter of Proteus, that great power, the Old Man of the Sea. My troubles must have moved her to the heart when she met me trudging by myself without my men. They kept roaming around the beach, day in, day out, fishing with twisted hooks, their bellies racked by hunger. Well, she came right up to me, filled with questions: 'Are you a fool, stranger — soft in the head and lazy too? Or do you let things slide because you //Areyour pain? Here you are, cooped up on an island far too long, with no way out of it, none that you can find, while all your shipmates' spirit ebbs away.' So she prodded and 1 replied at once, 'Let me tell you, goddess — whoever you are — I'm hardly landlocked here of my own free will. So 1 must have angered one of the deathless gods who rule the skies up there. But you tell me — you immortals know it all — which one of you blocks my way here, keeps me from my voyage? How can 1 cross the swarming sea and reach home at last?' And the glistening goddess reassured me warmly, 'Of course, my friend, I'll answer all your questions. Who haunts these parts? Proteus of Egypt does, the immortal Old Man of the Sea who never lies, who sounds the deep in all its depths, Poseidon's servant. He's my father, they say, he gave me life. And he, if only you ambush him somehow and pin him down, will tell you the way to go, the stages of your voyage, how you can cross the swarming sea and reach home at last. And he can tell you too, if you want to press him — you aredi king, it seems — all that's occurred within your palace, good and bad, while you've been gone your long and painful way.' 'Then you are the one' — 1 quickly took her up. 'Show me the trick to trap this ancient power. or he'll see or sense me first and slip away. It's hard for a mortal man to force a god.' 'True, my friend,' the glistening one agreed, and again I'll tell you all you need to know. When the sun stands striding at high noon, then up from the waves he comes — the Old Man of the Sea who never lies — under a West Wind's gust that shrouds him round in shuddering dark swells, and once he's out on land he heads for his bed of rest in deep hollow caves and around him droves of seals — sleek pups bred by his lovely ocean-lady — bed down too in a huddle, flopping up from the gray surf, giving off the sour reek of the salty ocean depths. I'll lead you there myself at the break of day and couch you all for attack, side-by-side. Choose three men from your crew, choose well, the best you've got aboard the good decked hulls. Now 1 will tell you all the old wizard's tricks ... First he will make his rounds and count the seals and once he's checked their number, reviewed them all, down in their midst he'll lie, like a shepherd with his flock. That's your moment. Soon as you see him bedded down, muster your heart and strength and hold him fast, wildly as he writhes and fights you to escape. He'll try all kinds of escape — ^twist and turn into every beast that moves across the earth, transforming himself into water, superhuman fire, but you hold on for dear life, hug him all the harder! And when, at last, he begins to ask you questions — back in the shape you saw him sleep at first — relax your grip and set the old god free and ask him outright, hero, which of the gods is up in arms against you? How can you cross the swarming sea and reach home at last?' So she urged and under the breaking surf she dove as I went back to our squadron beached in sand, my heart a heaving storm at every step ... Once I reached my ship hauled up on shore we made our meal and the godsent night came down and then we slept at the sea's smooth shelving edge. When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more 1 set out down the coast of the wide-ranging sea, praying hard to the gods for all their help, taking with me the three men 1 trusted most on every kind of mission. Eidothea, now, had slipped beneath the sea's engulfing folds but back from the waves she came with four sealskins, all freshly stripped, to deceive her father blind. She scooped out lurking-places deep in the sand and sat there waiting as we approached her post, then couching us side-by-side she flung a sealskin over each man's back. Now there was an ambush that would have overpowered us all — overpowering, true, the awful reek of all those sea-fed brutes! Who'd dream of bedding down with a monster of the deep? But the goddess sped to our rescue, found the cure with ambrosia, daubing it under each man's nose — that lovely scent, it drowned the creatures' stench. So all morning we lay there waiting, spirits steeled, while seals came crowding, jostling out of the sea and flopped down in rows, basking along the surf. At high noon the old man emerged from the waves and found his fat-fed seals and made his rounds, counting them off, counting usthe first four, but he had no inkling of all the fraud afoot. Then down he lay and slept, but we with a battle-cry, we rushed him, flung our arms around him — he'd lost nothing, the old rascal, none of his cunning quick techniques! First he shifted into a great bearded lion and then a serpent — a panther — a ramping wild boar — a torrent of water — a tree with soaring branchtops — but we held on for dear life, braving it out until, at last, that quick-change artist, the old wizard, began to weary of all this and burst out into rapid-fire questions: 'Which god, Menelaus, conspired with you to trap me in ambush? seize me against my will? What on earth do you want?' 'You know, old man,' 1 countered now. Why put me off with questions? Here 1 am, cooped up on an island far too long, with no way out of it, none that 1 can find, while my spirit ebbs away. But you tell me — you immortals know it all — which one of you blocks my way here, keeps me from my voyage? How can 1 cross the swarming sea and reach home at last?' 'How wrong you were!' the seer shot back at once. 'You should have offered Zeus and the other gods a handsome sacrifice, then embarked, if you ever hoped for a rapid journey home across the wine-dark sea. It's not your destiny yet to see your loved ones, reach your own grand house, your native land at last, not till you sail back through Egyptian waters — the great Nile swelled by the rains of Zeus — and make a splendid rite to the deathless gods who rule the vaulting skies. Then, only then will the gods grant you the voyage you desire.' So he urged, and broke the heart inside me, having to double back on the mist-bound seas, back to Egypt, that, that long and painful way ... Nevertheless 1 caught my breath and answered, 'That 1 will do, old man, as you command. But tell me this as well, and leave out nothing: Did all the Achaeans reach home in the ships unharmed, all we left behind, Nestor and 1, en route from Troy? Or did any die some cruel death by shipwreck or die in the arms of loved ones, once they 'd wound down the long coil of war?' And he lost no time in saying, 'Son of Atreus, why do you ask me that? Why do you need to know? Why probe my mind? You won't stay dry-eyed long, 1 warn you, once you have heard the whole story. Many of them were killed, many survived as well, but only two who captained your bronze-armored units died on the way home — you know who died in the fighting, you were there yourself. And one is still alive, held captive, somewhere, off in the endless seas ... Ajax, now, went down with his long-oared fleet. First Poseidon drove him onto the cliffs of Gyrae, looming cliffs, then saved him from the breakers — he'd have escaped his doom, too, despite Athena's hate, if he hadn't flung that brazen boast, the mad blind fool. "In the teeth of the gods," he bragged, "1 have escaped the ocean's sheer abyss!" Poseidon heard that frantic vaunt and the god grasped his trident in both his massive hands and struck the Gyraean headland, hacked the rock in two, and the giant stump stood fast but the jagged spur where Ajax perched at first, the raving madman — toppling into the sea, it plunged him down, down in the vast, seething depths. And so he died, having drunk his fill of brine. Your brother? He somehow escaped that fate; Agamemnon got away in his beaked ships. Queen Hera pulled him through. But just as he came abreast of Malea's beetling cape a hurricane snatched him up and swept him way off course — groaning, desperate — driving him over the fish-infested sea to the wild borderland where Thgestes made his home in days of old and his son Aegisthus lived now. But even from there a safe return seemed likely. yes, the immortals swung the wind around to fair and the victors sailed home. How rejoiced, Atrides setting foot on his fatherland once more — he took that native earth in his hands and kissed it, hot tears flooding his eyes, so thrilled to see his land! But a watchman saw him too — from a lookout high above — a spy that cunning Aegisthus stationed there, luring the man with two gold bars in payment. One whole year he'd watched ... so the great king would not get past unseen. his fighting power intact for self-defense. The spy ran the news to his master 's halls and Aegisthus quickly set his stealthy trap. Picking the twenty best recruits from town he packed them in ambush at one end of the house, at the other he ordered a banquet dressed and spread and went to welcome the conquering hero, Agamemnon, went with team and chariot, and a mind aswarm with evil. Up from the shore he led the king, he ushered him in — suspecting nothing of all his doom — he feasted him well then cut him down as a man cuts down some ox at the trough! Not one of your brother's men-at-arms was left alive, none of Aegisthus' either. All, killed in the palace.' So Proteus said, and his story crushed my heart. 1 knelt down in the sand and wept. I'd no desire to go on living and see the rising light of day. But once I'd had my fill of tears and writhing there, the Old Man of the Sea who never lies continued, 'No more now, Menelaus. How long must you weep? Withering tears, what good can come of tears? None 1 know of. Strive instead to return to your native country — hurry home at once! Either you'll find the murderer still alive or Orestes will have beaten you to the kill. You'll be in time to share the funeral feast.' So he pressed, and I felt my heart, my old pride, for all my grieving, glow once more in my chest and 1 asked the seer in a rush of winging words, 'Those two 1 know now. Tell me the third man's name. Who is still alive, held captive off in the endless seas? Unless he's dead by now. 1 want to know the truth though it grieves me all the more.' 'Odysseus' — the old prophet named the third at once — 'Laertes' son, who makes his home in Ithaca ... 1 saw him once on an island, weeping live warm tears in the nymph Calypso's house — she holds him there by force. He has no way to voyage home to his own native land, no trim ships in reach, no crew to ply the oars and send him scudding over the sea's broad back. But about your destiny, Menelaus, dear to Zeus, it's not for you to die and meet your fate in the stallion-land of Argos, no, the deathless ones will sweep you off to the world's end, the Elysian Fields, where gold-haired Rhadamanthys waits, where life glides on in immortal ease for mortal man; no snow, no winter onslaught, never a downpour there but night and day the Ocean River sends up breezes, singing winds of the West refreshing all mankind. All this because you are Helen's husband now — the gods count you the son-in-law of Zeus.' So he divined and down the breaking surf he dove as 1 went back to the ships with my brave men, my heart a rising tide at every step. Once 1 reached my craft hauled up on shore we made our meal and the godsent night came down and then we slept at the sea's smooth shelving edge. When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more we hauled the vessels down to the sunlit breakers first then stepped the masts amidships, canvas brailed — the crews swung aboard, they sat to the oars in ranks and in rhythm churned the water white with stroke on stroke. Back we went to the Nile swelled by the rains of Zeus, I moored the ships and sacrificed in a splendid rite, and once I'd slaked the wrath of the everlasting gods I raised a mound for Agamemnon, his undying glory. All this done, 1 set sail and the gods sent me a stiff following wind that sped me home, home to the native land 1 love. But come, my boy, stay on in my palace now with me, at least till ten or a dozen days have passed. Then I'll give you a princely send-off — shining gifts, three stallions and a chariot burnished bright — and I'll add a gorgeous cup so you can pour libations out to the deathless gods on high and remember Menelaus all your days." Telemachus, summoning up his newfound tact, replied, "Please, Menelaus, don't keep me quite so long. True, I'd gladly sit beside you one whole year without a twinge of longing for home or parents. It's wonderful how you tell your stories, all you say — 1 delight to listen! Yes, but now, I'm afraid, my comrades must be restless in sacred Pylos, and here you'd hold me just a little longer. As for the gift you give me, let it be a keepsake. Those horses 1 really cannot take to Ithaca; better to leave them here to be your glory. You rule a wide level plain where the fields of clover roll and galingale and wheat and oats and glistening full-grain barley. No running-room for mares in Ithaca though, no meadows. Goat, not stallion, land, yet it means the world to me. None of the rugged islands slanting down to sea is good for pasture or good for bridle paths, but Ithaca, best of islands, crowns them all!" So he declared. The lord of the warcry smiled, patted him with his hand and praised his guest, concluding, "Good blood runs in you, dear boy, your words are proof. Certainly I'll exchange the gifts. The power's mine. Of all the treasures lying heaped in my palace you shall have the finest, most esteemed. Why, I'll give you a mixing-bowl, forged to perfection — it's solid silver finished off with a lip of gold. Hephaestus made it himself. And a royal friend, Phaedimus, king of Sidon, lavished it on me when his palace welcomed me on passage home. How pleased I'd be if you took it as a gift! " And now as the two confided in each other, banqueters arrived at the great king's palace, leading their own sheep, bearing their hearty wine, and their wives in lovely headbands sent along the food. And so they bustled about the halls preparing dinner ... But all the while the suitors, before Odysseus' palace, amused themselves with discus and long throwing spears, out on the leveled grounds, free and easy as always, full of swagger. But lord Antinous sat apart, dashing Eurymachus beside him, ringleaders, head and shoulders the strongest of the lot. Phronius' son Noemon approached them now, quick to press Antinous with a question: "Antinous, have we any notion or not when Telemachus will return from sandy Pylos? He sailed in a ship of mine and now 1 need her back to cross over to Elis Plain where 1 keep a dozen horses, brood-mares suckling some heavy-duty mules, unbroken. I'd like to drive one home and break him in." That dumbfounded them both. They never dreamed the prince had gone to Pylos, Neleus' city — certain the boy was still nearby somewhere, out on his farm with flocks or with the swineherd. "Tell me the truth!" Antinous wheeled on Noemon. "When did he go? And what young crew went with him? Ithaca's best? Or his own slaves and servants? Surely he has enough to man a ship. Tell me this — be clear — I've got to know: did he commandeer your ship against your will or did you volunteer it once he'd won you over?" "1 volunteered it, of course, " Noemon said. "What else could anyone do, when such a man, a prince weighed down with troubles, asked a favor? Hard to deny him anything. And the young crew that formed his escort? Well, they're the finest men on the island, next to us. And Mentor took command — 1 saw him climb aboard — or a god who looked like Mentor head to foot, and that's what 1 find strange. 1 saw good Mentor yesterday, just at sunup, here. But clearly he boarded ship for Pylos days ago." With that he headed back to his father's house, leaving the two lords stiff with indignation. They made the suitors sit down in a group and stop their games at once. Eupithes' son Antinous rose up in their midst to speak, his dark heart filled with fury, blazing with anger — eyes like searing fire: "By god, what a fine piece of work he's carried off! Telemachus — ^what insolence — and we thought his little jaunt would come to grief. But in spite of us all, look, the young cub slips away , just like that— picks the best crew in the land and off he sails. And this is just the start of the trouble he can make. Zeus kill that brazen boy before he hits his prime! Quick, fetch me a swift ship and twenty men — I'll waylay him from ambush, board him coming back in the straits between Ithaca and rocky Same. This gallant voyage of his to find his father will find wrecked at last!" They all roared approval, urged him on, rose at once and retired to Odysseus' palace. But not for long was Penelope unaware of the grim plots her suitors planned in secret. The herald Medon told her. He'd overheard their schemes, listening in outside the court while they wove on within. He rushed the news through the halls to tell the queen who greeted him as he crossed her chamber 's threshold: "Herald, why have the young blades sent you now? To order King Odysseus' serving- women to stop their work and slave to fix their feast? 1 hate their courting, their running riot here — would to god that this meal, here and now, were their last meal on earth! Day after day, all of you swarming, draining our life's blood, my wary son's estate. What, didn't you listen to your fathers — when you were children, years ago — telling you how Odysseus treated them, your parents? Never an unfair word, never an unfair action among his people here, though that's the way of our god-appointed kings, hating one man, loving the next, with luck. Not Odysseus. Never an outrage done to any man alive. But you, you and your ugly outbursts, shameful acts, they're plain to see. Look at the thanks he gets for all past acts of kindness!" Medon replied, sure of his own discretion, "Ah my queen, if only tJiatyNsre the worst of all you face. Now your suitors are plotting something worse, harsher, cruder. God forbid they bring it off! They 're poised to cut Telemachus down with bronze swords on his way back home. He's sailed off, you see ... for news of his father — ^to sacred Pylos first, then out to the sunny hills of Lacedaemon." Her knees gave way on the spot, her heart too. She stood there speechless a while, struck dumb, tears filling her eyes, her warm voice choked. At last she found some words to make reply: "Oh herald, why has my child gone and left me? No need in the world for him to board the ships, those chariots of the sea that sweep men on, driving across the ocean's endless wastes ... Does he want his very name wiped off the earth?" Medon, the soul of thoughtfulness, responded, "1 don't know if a god inspired your son or the boy 's own impulse led him down to Pylos, but he went to learn of his father's journey home, or whatever fate he's met." Back through King Odysseus' house he went but a cloud of heartbreak overwhelmed the queen. She could bear no longer sitting on a chair though her room had chairs aplenty. Down she sank on her well-built chamber's floor, weeping, pitifully, as the women whimpered round her, all the women, young and old, who served her house. Penelope, sobbing uncontrollably, cried out to them, "Hear me, dear ones! Zeus has given me torment — me above all the others born and bred in my da\^. My lionhearted husband, lost, long years ago, who excelled the Argives all in every strength — that great man whose fame resounds through Hellas right to the depths of Argos! But now my son, my darling boy — the whirlwinds have ripped him out of the halls without a trace! 1 never heard he'd gone — not even from you, you hard, heartless ... not one of you even thought to rouse me from my bed, though well you knew when he boarded that black ship. Oh if only 1 had learned he was planning such a journey , he would have stayed, by god, keen as he was to sail — or left me dead right here within our palace. Go, someone, quickly! Call old Dolius now, the servant my father gave me when 1 came, the man who tends my orchard green with trees, so he can run to Laertes, sit beside him, tell him the whole story, blow-by-blow. Perhaps — who knows? — he'll weave some plan, he'll come out of hiding, plead with all these people mad to destroy his line, his son's line of kings! " "Oh dear girl, " Eurycleia the fond old nurse replied, "kill me then with a bronze knife — no mercy — or let me live, here in the palace — I'll hide nothing from you now! 1 knew it all, 1 gave him all he asked for, bread and mellow wine, but he made me take a mighty oath that 1, 1 wouldn't tell you, no, not till ten or a dozen days had passed or you missed the lad yourself and learned he'd gone, so tears would never mar your lovely face ... Come, bathe now, put some fresh clothes on, climb to the upper rooms with all your women and pray to Pallas, daughter of storming Zeus — 5Aemay save Telemachus yet, even at death's door. Don't worry an old man, worried enough by now. 1 can't believe the blessed gods so hate the heirs of King Arcesius, through and through. One will still live on — 1 know it — born to rule this lofty house and the green fields far and wide." With that she lulled Penelope's grief and dried her eyes of tears. And the queen bathed and put fresh clothing on, climbed to the upper rooms with all her women and sifting barley into a basket, prayed to Pallas, "Hear me, daughter of Zeus whose shield is thunder — tireless one, Athena! If ever, here in his halls, resourceful King Odysseus burned rich thighs of sheep or oxen in your honor, oh remember it now for my sake, save my darling son, defend him from these outrageous, overbearing suitors! " She shrilled a high cry and the goddess heard her prayer as the suitors burst into uproar through the shadowed halls and one of the lusty young men began to brag, "Listen, our long-courted queen's preparing us all a marriage — with no glimmer at all how the murder of her son has been decreed." Boasting so, with no glimmer at all of what had been decreed. But Antinous took the floor and issued orders: "Stupid fools! Muzzle your bragging now — before someone slips inside and reports us. Up now, not a sound, drive home our plan — it suits us well, we approved it one and all." With that he picked out twenty first-rate men and down they went to the swift ship at the sea's edge. First they hauled the craft into deeper water, stepped the mast amidships, canvas brailed, made oars fast in the leather oarlock straps while zealous aides-in-arms brought weapons on. They moored her well out in the channel, disembarked and took their meal on shore, waiting for dusk to fall. But there in her upper rooms she lay, Penelope lost in thought, fasting, shunning food and drink, brooding now ... would her fine son escape his death or go down at her overweening suitors' hands? Her mind in torment, wheeling like some lion at bay, dreading gangs of hunters closing their cunning ring around him for the finish. Harried so she was, when a deep kind sleep overcame her, back she sank and slept, her limbs fell limp and still. And again the bright-eyed goddess Pallas thought of one more way to help. She made a phantom now, its build like a woman's build, Iphthime's, yes, another daughter of generous Lord Icarius, Eumelus' bride, who made her home in Pherae. Athena sped her on to King Odysseus' house to spare Penelope, worn with pain and sobbing, further spells of grief and storms of tears. The phantom entered her bedroom, passing quickly in through the doorbolt slit and hovering at her head she rose and spoke now: "Sleeping, Penelope, your heart so wrung with sorrow? No need, 1 tell you, no, the gods who live at ease can't bear to let you weep and rack your spirit. Your son will still come home — it is decreed. He's never wronged the gods in any way." And Penelope murmured back, still cautious, drifting softly now at the gate of dreams, "Why have you come, my sister? Your visits all too rare in the past, for you make your home so very far away. You tell me to lay to rest the grief and tears that overwhelm me now, torment me, heart and soul? With my lionhearted husband lost long years ago, who excelled the Argives all in every strength? That great man whose fame resounds through Hellas right to the depths of Argos ... And now my darling boy, he's off and gone in a hollow ship! Just a youngster, still untrained for war or stiff debate. Him, 1 mourn him even more than 1 do my husband — quake in terror for all that he might suffer either on open sea or shores he goes to visit. Hordes of enemies scheme against him now, keen to kill him off before he can reach his native land again." "Courage!" the shadowy phantom reassured her. "Don't be overwhelmed by all your direst fears. He travels with such an escort, one that others would pray to stand beside them. She has power — Pallas Athena. She pities you in your tears. She wings me here to tell you all these things." But the circumspect Penelope replied, "If you area, god and have heard a god's own voice, come, tell me about that luckless man as well. Is he still alive? does he see the light of day? Or is he dead already, lost in the House of Death? " "About that man, " the shadowy phantom answered, "1 cannot tell you the story start to finish, whether he's dead or alive. It's wrong to lead you on with idle words. " At that she glided off by the doorpost past the bolt — gone on a lifting breeze. Icarius' daughter started up from sleep, her spirit warmed now that a dream so clear had come to her in darkest night. But the suitors boarded now and sailed the sea-lanes, plotting in their hearts Telemachus' plunge to death. Off in the middle channel lies a rocky island, just between Ithaca and Same's rugged cliffs — Asteris — not large, but it has a cove, a harbor with two mouths where ships can hide. Here the Achaeans lurked in ambush for the prince. BookV Odysseus — Nymph and Shipwreck As Dawn rose up from bed by her lordly mate Tithonus, bringing light to immortal gods and mortal men, the gods sat down in council, circling Zeus the thunder king whose power rules the world. Athena began, recalling Odysseus to their thoughts, the goddess deeply moved by the man's long ordeal, held captive still in the nymph Calypso's house: "Father Zeus — you other happy gods who never die — never let any sceptered king be kind and gentle now, not with all his heart, or set his mind on justice — no, let him be cruel and always practice outrage. Think: not one of the people whom he ruled remembers Odysseus now, that godlike man, and kindly as a father to his children. Now he's left to pine on an island, racked with grief in the nymph Calypso's house — she holds him there by force. He has no way to voyage home to his own native land, no trim ships in reach, no crew to ply the oars and send him scudding over the sea's broad back. And now his dear son ... they plot to kill the boy on his way back home. Yes, he has sailed off for news of his father, to holy Pylos first, then out to the sunny hills of Lacedaemon." "My child, ' Zeus who marshals the thunderheads replied, "what nonsense you let slip through your teeth. Come now, wasn't the plan your own? You conceived it yourself: Odysseus shall return and pay the traitors back. Telemachus? Sail him home with all your skill — the power is yours, no doubt — home to his native country all unharmed while the suitors limp to port, defeated, baffled men." With those words, Zeus turned to his own son Hermes. "You are our messenger, Hermes, sent on all our missions. Announce to the nymph with lovely braids our fixed decree: Odysseus journeys home — ^the exile must return. But not in the convoy of the gods or mortal men. No, on a lashed, makeshift raft and wrung with pains, on the twentieth day he will make his landfall, fertile Scheria, the land of Phaeacians, close kin to the gods themselves, who with all their hearts will prize him like a god and send him off in a ship to his own beloved land, giving him bronze and hoards of gold and robes — more plunder than he could ever have won from Troy if Odysseus had returned intact with his fair share. So his destiny ordains. He shall see his loved ones, reach his high-roofed house, his native land at last." So Zeus decreed and the giant-killing guide obeyed at once. Quickly under his feet he fastened the supple sandals, ever-glowing gold, that wing him over the waves and boundless earth with the rush of gusting winds. He seized the wand that enchants the eyes of men whenever Hermes wants, or wakes us up from sleep. That wand in his grip, the powerful giant-killer, swooping down from Pieria, down the high clear air, plunged to the sea and skimmed the waves like a tern that down the deadly gulfs of the barren salt swells glides and dives for fish, dipping its beating wings in bursts of spray — so Hermes skimmed the crests on endless crests. But once he gained that island worlds apart, up from the deep-blue sea he climbed to dry land and strode on till he reached the spacious cave where the nymph with lovely braids had made her home, and he found her there inside ... A great fire blazed on the hearth and the smell of cedar cleanly split and sweetwood burning bright wafted a cloud of fragrance down the island. Deep inside she sang, the goddess Calypso, lifting her breathtaking voice as she glided back and forth before her loom, her golden shuttle weaving. Thick, luxuriant woods grew round the cave, alders and black poplars, pungent cypress too, and there birds roosted, folding their long wings, owls and hawks and the spread-beaked ravens of the sea, black skimmers who make their living off the waves. And round the mouth of the cavern trailed a vine laden with clusters, bursting with ripe grapes. Four springs in a row, bubbling clear and cold, running side-by -side, took channels left and right. Soft meadows spreading round were starred with violets, lush with beds of parsley. Why, even a deathless god who came upon that place would gaze in wonder, heart entranced with pleasure. Hermes the guide, the mighty giant-killer, stood there, spellbound ... But once he'd had his fill of marveling at it all he briskly entered the deep vaulted cavern. Calypso, lustrous goddess, knew him at once, as soon as she saw his features face-to-face. Immortals are never strangers to each other, no matter how distant one may make her home. But as for great Odysseus — Hermes could not find him within the cave. Off he sat on a headland, weeping there as always, wrenching his heart with sobs and groans and anguish, gazing out over the barren sea through blinding tears. But Calypso, lustrous goddess, questioned Hermes, seating him on a glistening, polished chair. "God of the golden wand, why have you come? A beloved, honored friend, but it's been so long, your visits much too rare. Tell me what's on your mind. I'm eager to do it, whatever I can do ... whatever can be done." And the goddess drew a table up beside him, heaped with ambrosia, mixed him deep-red nectar. Hermes the guide and giant-killer ate and drank. Once he had dined and fortified himself with food he launched right in, replying to her questions: "As one god to another, you ask me why I've come. I'll tell you the whole story, mince no words — your wish is my command. It was Zeus who made me come, no choice of mine. Who would willingly roam across a salty waste so vast, so endless? Think: no city of men in sight, and not a soul to offer the gods a sacrifice and burn the fattest victims. But there is no way, you know, for another god to thwart the will of storming Zeus and make it come to nothing. Zeus claims you keep beside you a most unlucky man, most harried of all who fought for Priam's Troy nine years, sacking the city in the tenth, and then set sail for home. But voyaging back they outraged Queen Athena who loosed the gales and pounding seas against them. There all the rest of his loyal shipmates died but the wind drove him on, the current bore him here. Now Zeus commands you to send him off with all good speed: it is not his fate to die here, far from his own people. Destiny still ordains that he shall see his loved ones, reach his high-roofed house, his native land at last." But lustrous Calypso shuddered at those words and burst into a flight of indignation. "Hard-hearted you are, you gods! You unrivaled lords of jealousy — scandalized when goddesses sleep with mortals, openly, even when one has made the man her husband. So when Dawn with her rose-red fingers took Orion, you gods in your everlasting ease were horrified till chaste Artemis throned in gold attacked him, out on Delos, shot him to death with gentle shafts. And so when Demeter the graceful one with lovely braids gave way to her passion and made love with lasion, bedding down in a furrow plowed three times — Zeus got wind of it soon enough, I'd say, and blasted the man to death with flashing bolts. So now at last, you gods, you train your spite on me for keeping a mortal man beside me. The man 1 saved, riding astride his keel-board, all alone, when Zeus with one hurl of a white-hot bolt had crushed his racing warship down the wine-dark sea. There all the rest of his loyal shipmates died but the wind drove him on, the current bore him here. And /welcomed him warmly, cherished him, even vowed to make the man immortal, ageless, all his days ... But since there is no way for another god to thwart the will of storming Zeus and make it come to nothing, let the man go — if the Almighty insists, commands — and destroy himself on the barren salt sea! I'll send him off, but not with any escort. 1 have no ships in reach, no crew to ply the oars and send him scudding over the sea's broad back. But I will gladly advise him — I'll hide nothing — so he can reach his native country all unharmed." And the guide and giant-killer reinforced her words: "Release him at once, just so. Steer clear of the rage of Zeus! Or down the years he'll fume and make your life a hell." With that the powerful giant-killer sped away. The queenly nymph sought out the great Odysseus — the commands of Zeus still ringing in her ears — and found him there on the headland, sitting, still, weeping, his eyes never dry, his sweet life flowing away with the tears he wept for his foiled journey home, since the nymph no longer pleased. In the nights, true, he'd sleep with her in the arching cave — he had no choice — unwilling lover alongside lover all too willing ... But all his days he'd sit on the rocks and beaches, wrenching his heart with sobs and groans and anguish, gazing out over the barren sea through blinding tears. So coming up to him now, the lustrous goddess ventured, "No need, my unlucky one, to grieve here any longer, no, don't waste your life away. Now 1 am willing, heart and soul, to send you off at last. Come, take bronze tools, cut your lengthy timbers, make them into a broad-beamed raft and top it off with a half-deck high enough to sweep you free and clear on the misty seas. And 1 myself will stock her with food and water, ruddy wine to your taste — all to stave off hunger — give you clothing, send you a stiff following wind so you can reach your native country all unharmed. If only the ffods are willing. They rule the vaulting skies. They're stronger than 1 to plan and drive things home." Long-enduring Odysseus shuddered at that and broke out in a sharp flight of protest. "Passage home? Never. Surely you're plotting something else, goddess, urging me — in a raft — to cross the ocean's mighty gulfs. So vast, so full of danger not even deep-sea ships can make it through, swift as they are and buoyed up by the winds of Zeus himself. 1 won't set foot on a raft until you showgood faith, until you consent to swear, goddess, a binding oath you'll never plot some new intrigue to harm me!" He was so intense the lustrous goddess smiled, stroked him with her hand, savored his name arid chided, "Ah what a wicked man you are, and never at a loss. What a thing to imagine, what a thing to say! Earth be my witness now, the vaulting Sky above and the dark cascading waters of the Styx — 1 swear by the greatest, grimmest oath that binds the happy gods; 1 will never plot some new intrigue to harm you- Never. All 1 have in mind and devise for you are the very plans I'd fashion for myself if 1 were in your straits. My every impulse bends to what is right. Not iron, trust me, the heart within my breast. 1 am all compassion." And lustrous Calypso quickly led the way as he followed in the footsteps of the goddess. They reached the arching cavern, man and god as one, and Odysseus took the seat that Hermes just left, while the nymph set out before him every kind of food and drink that mortal men will take. Calypso sat down face-to-face with the king and the women served her nectar and ambrosia. They reached out for the good things that lay at hand and when they'd had their fill of food and drink the lustrous one took up a new approach. "So then, royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, man of exploits, still eager to leave at once and hurry back to your own home, your beloved native land? Good luck to you, even so. Farewell! But if you only knew, down deep, what pains are fated to fill your cup before you reach that shore. you'd stay right here, preside in our house with me and be immortal. Much as you long to see your wife, the one you pine for all your days ... and yet 1 just might claim to be nothing less than she, neither in face nor figure. Hardly right, is it, for mortal woman to rival immortal goddess? How, in build? in beauty?" "Ah great goddess," worldly Odysseus answered, "don't be angry with me, please. All that you say is true, how well 1 know. Look at my wise Penelope. She falls far short of you, your beauty, stature. She is mortal after all and you, you never age or die ... Nevertheless 1 long — 1 pine, all my days — to travel home and see the dawn of my return. And if a god will wreck me yet again on the wine-dark sea, 1 can bear that too, with a spirit tempered to endure. Much have 1 suffered, labored long and hard by now in the waves and wars. Add this to the total — bring the trial on!" Even as he spoke the sun set and the darkness swept the earth. And now, withdrawing into the cavern's deep recesses, long in each other's arms they lost themselves in love. When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more Odysseus quickly dressed himself in cloak and shirt while the nymph slipped on a loose, glistening robe, filmy, a joy to the eye, and round her waist she ran a brocaded golden belt and over her head a scarf to shield her brow, then turned to plan the great man's voyage home. She gave him a heavy bronze ax that fit his grip, both blades well-honed, with a fine olive haft lashed firm to its head. She gave him a polished smoothing-adze as well and then she led the way to the island's outer edge where trees grew tall, alders, black poplars and firs that shot sky-high. seasoned, drying for years, ideal for easy floating. Once she'd shown her guest where the tall timber stood, Calypso the lustrous goddess headed home again. He set to cutting trunks — the work was done in no time. Twenty in all he felled, he trimmed them clean with his ax and split them deftly, trued them straight to the line. Meanwhile the radiant goddess brought him drills — he bored through all his planks and wedged them snugly, knocking them home together, locked with pegs and bolts. Broad in the beam and bottom flat as a merchantman when a master shipwright turns out her hull, so broad the craft Odysseus made himself. Working away at speed he put up half -decks pinned to close-set ribs and a sweep of gunwales rounded off the sides. He fashioned the mast next and sank its yard in deep and added a steering-oar to hold her right on course, then he fenced her stem to stern with twigs and wicker, bulwark against the sea-surge, floored with heaps of brush. And lustrous Calypso came again, now with bolts of cloth to make the sail, and he finished that off too, expertly. Braces, sheets and brails — he rigged all fast on board, then eased her down with levers into the sunlit sea. That was the fourth day and all his work was done. On the fifth, the lovely goddess launched him from her island, once she had bathed and decked him out in fragrant clothes. And Calypso stowed two skins aboard — dark wine in one, the larger one held water — added a sack of rations, filled with her choicest meats to build his strength, and summoned a wind to bear him onward, fair and warm. The wind lifting his spirits high, royal Odysseus spread sail — gripping the tiller, seated astern — and now the master mariner steered his craft, sleep never closing his eyes, forever scanning the stars, the Pleiades and the Plowman late to set and the Great Bear that mankind also calls the Wagon: she wheels on her axis always fixed, watching the Hunter, and she alone is denied a plunge in the Ocean's baths. Hers were the stars the lustrous goddess told him to keep hard to port as he cut across the sea. And seventeen days he sailed, making headway well; on the eighteenth, shadowy mountains slowly loomed ... the Phaeacians' island reaching toward him now, over the misty breakers, rising like a shield. But now Poseidon, god of the earthquake, saw him — just returning home from his Ethiopian friends, from miles away on the Solymi mountain-range he spied Odysseus sailing down the sea and it made his fury boil even more. He shook his head and rumbled to himself, "Outrageous! Look how the gods have changed their minds about Odysseus — while /was off with my Ethiopians. Just look at him there, nearing Phaeacia's shores where he's fated to escape his noose of pain that's held him until now. Still my hopes ride high — I'll give that man his swamping fill of trouble!" With that he rammed the clouds together — both hands clutching his trident — churned the waves into chaos, whipping all the gales from every quarter, shrouding over in thunderheads the earth and sea at once — and night swept down from the sky — East and South Winds clashed and the raging West and North, sprung from the heavens, roiled heaving breakers up — and Odysseus' knees quaked, his spirit too; numb with fear he spoke to his own great heart: "Wretched man — ^what becomes of me now, at last? 1 fear the nymph foretold it all too well — on the high seas, she said, before 1 can reach my native land I'll fill my cup of pain! And now, look, it all comes to pass. What monstrous clouds — King Zeus crowning the whole wide heaven black — churning the seas in chaos, gales blasting, raging around my head from every quarter — my death-plunge in a flash, it's certain now! Three, four times blessed, my friends-in arms who died on the plains of Troy those years ago, serving the sons of Atreus to the end. Would to god I'd died there too and met my fate that day the Trojans, swarms of them, hurled at me^Niih bronze spears, fighting over the corpse of proud Achilles! A hero's funeral then, my glory spread by comrades — now what a wretched death I'm doomed to die!" At that a massive wave came crashing down on his head, a terrific onslaught spinning his craft round and round — he was thrown clear of the decks — the steering-oar wrenched from his grasp — and in one lightning attack the brawling galewinds struck full-force, snapping the mast mid-shaft and hurling the sail and sailyard far across the sea. He went under a good long while, no fast way out, no struggling up from under the giant wave's assault, his clothing dragged him down — divine Calypso's gifts — but at last he fought his way to the surface spewing bitter brine, streams of it pouring down his head. But half-drowned as he was, he'd not forget his craft — he lunged after her through the breakers, laying hold and huddling amidships, fled the stroke of death. Pell-mell the rollers tossed her along down-current, wild as the North Wind tossing thistle along the fields at high harvest — dry stalks clutching each other tightly — so the galewinds tumbled her down the sea, this way, that way, now the South Wind flinging her over to North to sport with, now the East Wind giving her up to West to harry on and on. But someone saw him — Cadmus' daughter with lovely ankles, Ino, a mortal woman once with human voice and called Leucothea now she lives in the sea's salt depths, esteemed by all the gods as she deserves. She pitied Odysseus, tossed, tormented so — she broke from the waves like a shearwater on the wing. lit on the wreck and asked him kindly, "Ah poor man, why is the god of earthquakes so dead set against you? Strewing your way with such a crop of troubles! But he can't destroy you, not for all his anger. Just do as 1 say. You seem no fool to me. Strip off those clothes and leave your craft for the winds to hurl, and swim for it now, you must, strike out with your arms for landfall there, Phaeacian land where destined safety waits. Here, take this scarf, tie it around your waist — it is immortal. Nothing to fear now, neither pain nor death. But once you grasp the mainland with your hands untie it quickly, throw it into the wine-dark sea, far from the shore, but you, you turn your head away!" With that the goddess handed him the scarf and slipped back in the heavy breaking seas like a shearwater once again — and a dark heaving billow closed above her. But battle-weary Odysseus weighed two courses, deeply torn, probing his fighting spirit: "Oh no — 1 fear another immortal weaves a snare to trap me, urging me to abandon ship! 1 won't. Not yet. That shore's too far away — 1 glimpsed it myself — ^where sAesays refuge waits. No, here's what I'll do, it's what seems best to me. As long as the timbers cling and joints stand fast, I'll hold out aboard her and take a whipping — once the breakers smash my craft to pieces, then I'll swim — no better plan for now." But just as great Odysseus thrashed things out, Poseidon god of the earthquake launched a colossal wave, terrible, murderous, arching over him, pounding down on him, hard as a windstorm blasting piles of dry parched chaff, scattering flying husks — so the long planks of his boat were scattered far and wide. But Odysseus leapt aboard one timber and riding it like a plunging racehorse stripped away his clothes, divine Calypso's gifts, and quickly tying the scarf around his waist he dove headfirst in the sea, stretched his arms and stroked for life itself. But again the mighty god of earthquakes spied him, shook his head and grumbled deep in his spirit, "Go, go, after all you've suffered — rove your miles of sea — till you fall in the arms of people loved by Zeus. Even so 1 can hardly think you'll find your punishments too light!" With that threat he lashed his team with their long flowing manes, gaining Aegae port where his famous palace stands. But Zeus's daughter Athena countered him at once. The rest of the winds she stopped right in their tracks, commanding them all to hush now, go to sleep. All but the boisterous North — she whipped him up and the goddess beat the breakers flat before Odysseus, dear to Zeus, so he could reach the Phaeacians, mingle with men who love their long oars and escape his death at last. Yes, but now, adrift on the heaving swells two nights, two days — quite lost — again and again the man foresaw his death. Then when Dawn with her lovely locks brought on the third day, the wind fell in an instant, all glazed to a dead calm, and Odysseus, scanning sharply, raised high by a groundswell, looked up and saw it — landfall, just ahead. Joy ... warm as the joy that children feel when they see their father's life dawn again, one who's lain on a sickbed racked with torment, wasting away, slowly, under some angry power's onslaught — then what joy when the gods deliver him from his pains! So warm, Odysseus' joy when he saw that shore, those trees, as he swam on, anxious to plant his feet on solid ground again. But just offshore, as far as a man's shout can carry, he caught the boom of a heavy surf on jagged reefs — roaring breakers crashing down on an ironbound coast, exploding in fury — the whole sea shrouded — sheets of spray — no harbors to hold ships, no roadstead where they'd ride, nothing but jutting headlands, riptooth reefs, cliffs. Odysseus' knees quaked and the heart inside him sank; he spoke to his fighting spirit, desperate: "Worse and worse! Now that Zeus has granted a glimpse of land beyond my hopes, now I've crossed this waste of water, the end in sight, there's no way out of the boiling surf — 1 see no way! Rugged reefs offshore, around them breakers roaring, above them a smooth rock face, rising steeply, look, and the surge too deep inshore, no spot to stand on my own two legs and battle free of death. If 1 clamber out, some big comber will hoist me, dash me against that cliff — my struggles all a waste! If 1 keep on swimming down the coast, trying to find a seabeach shelving against the waves, a sheltered cove — 1 dread it — another gale will snatch me up and haul me back to the fish-infested sea, retching in despair. Or a dark power will loose some monster at me, rearing out of the waves — one of the thousands Amphitrite's breakers teem with. Well 1 know the famous god of earthquakes hates my very name!" Just as that fear went churning through his mind a tremendous roller swept him toward the rocky coast where he'd have been flayed alive, his bones crushed, if the bright-eyed goddess Pallas had not inspired him now. He lunged for a reef, he seized it with both hands and clung for dear life, groaning until the giant wave surged past and so he escaped its force, but the breaker's backwash charged into him full fury and hurled him out to sea. Like pebbles stuck in the suckers of some octopus dragged from its lair — so strips of skin torn from his clawing hands stuck to the rock face. A heavy sea covered him over, then and there unlucky Odysseus would have met his death — against the will of Fate — but the bright-eyed one inspired him yet again. Fighting out from the breakers pounding toward the coast, out of danger he swam on, scanning the land, trying to find a seabeach shelving against the waves, a sheltered cove, and stroking hard he came abreast of a river 's mouth, running calmly, the perfect spot, he thought ... free of rocks, with a windbreak from the gales. As the current flowed he felt the river's god and prayed to him in spirit: "Hear me, lord, whoever you are, I've come to you, the answer to all my prayers — rescue me from the sea, the Sea-lord's curse! Even immortal gods will show a man respect, whatever wanderer seeks their help — like me — 1 throw myself on your mercy, on your current now — 1 have suffered greatly. Pity me, lord, your suppliant cries for help!" So the man prayed and the god stemmed his current, held his surge at once and smoothing out the swells before Odysseus now, drew him safe to shore at the river's mouth. His knees buckled, massive arms fell limp, the sea had beaten down his striving heart. His whole body swollen, brine aplenty gushing out of his mouth and nostrils — breathless, speechless, there he lay, with only a little strength left in him, deathly waves of exhaustion overwhelmed him now ... But once he regained his breath and rallied back to life, at last he loosed the goddess' scarf from his body, dropped it into the river flowing out to sea and a swift current bore it far downstream and suddenly Ino caught it in her hands. Struggling up from the banks, he flung himself in the deep reeds, he kissed the good green earth and addressed his fighting spirit, desperate still: "Man of misery, what next? Is this the end? If I wait out a long tense night by the banks, I fear the sharp frost and the soaking dew together will do me in — I'm bone-weary, about to breathe my last, and a cold wind blows from a river on toward morning. But what if I climb that slope, go for the dark woods and bed down in the thick brush? What if I'm spared the chill, fatigue, and a sweet sleep comes my way? I fear wild beasts will drag me off as quarry." But this was the better course, it struck him now. He set out for the woods and not far from the water found a grove with a clearing all around and crawled beneath two bushy olives sprung from the same root, one olive wild, the other well-bred stock. No sodden gusty winds could ever pierce them, nor could the sun's sharp rays invade their depths, nor could a downpour drench them through and through, so dense they grew together, tangling side-by-side. Odysseus crept beneath them, scraping up at once a good wide bed for himself with both hands. A fine litter of dead leaves had drifted in, enough to cover two men over, even three, in the wildest kind of winter known to man. Long-enduring great Odysseus, overjoyed at the sight, bedded down in the midst and heaped the leaves around him. As a man will bury his glowing brand in black ashes, off on a lonely farmstead, no neighbors near, to keep a spark alive — no need to kindle fire from somewhere else — so great Odysseus buried himself in leaves and Athena showered sleep upon his eyes ... sleep in a swift wave delivering him from all his pains and labors, blessed sleep that sealed his eyes at last. The Princess and the Stranger So there he lay at rest, the storm-tossed great Odysseus, borne down by his hard labors first and now deep sleep as Athena traveled through the countryside and reached the Phaeacians' city. Years ago they lived in a land of spacious dancing-circles, Hyperia, all too close to the overbearing Cyclops, stronger, violent brutes who harried them without end. So their godlike king, Nausithous, led the people off in a vast migration, settled them in Scheria, far from the men who toil on this earth — he flung up walls around the city, built the houses, raised the gods' temples and shared the land for plowing. But his fate had long since forced him down to Death and now Alcinous ruled, and the gods made him wise. straight to his house the clear-eyed Pallas went, full of plans for great Odysseus' journey home. She made her way to the gaily painted room where a young girl lay asleep ... a match for the deathless gods in build and beauty, Nausicaa, the daughter of generous King Alcinous. Two handmaids fair as the Graces slept beside her, flanking the two posts, with the gleaming doors closed. But the goddess drifted through like a breath of fresh air, rushed to the girl's bed and hovering close she spoke, in face and form like the shipman Dymas' daughter, a girl the princess' age, and dearest to her heart. Disguised, the bright-eyed goddess chided, "Nausicaa, how could your mother bear a careless girl like you? Look at your fine clothes, lying here neglected — with your marriage not far off, the day you should be decked in all your glory and offer elegant dress to those who form your escort. That's how a bride's good name goes out across the world and it brings her father and queenly mother joy. Come, let's go wash these clothes at the break of day — I'll help you, lend a hand, and the work will fly! You won't stay unwed long. The noblest men in the country court you now, all Phaeacians just like you, Phaeacia-born and raised. So come, first thing in the morning press your kingly father to harness the mules and wagon for you, all to carry your sashes, dresses, glossy spreads for your bed. It's so much nicer for you to ride than go on foot. The washing-pools are just too far from town." With that the bright-eyed goddess sped away to Olympus, where, they say, the gods' eternal mansion stands unmoved, never rocked by galewinds, never drenched by rains, nor do the drifting snows assail it, no, the clear air stretches away without a cloud, and a great radiance plays across that world where the blithe gods live all their days in bliss. There Athena went, once the bright-eyed one had urged the princess on. Dawn soon rose on her splendid throne and woke Nausicaa finely gowned. Still beguiled by her dream, down she went through the house to tell her parents now, her beloved father and mother. She found them both inside. Her mother sat at the hearth with several waiting- women, spinning yarn on a spindle, lustrous sea-blue wool. Her father she met as he left to join the lords at a council island nobles asked him to attend. She stepped up close to him, confiding, "Daddy dear, 1 wonder, won't you have them harness a wagon for me, the tall one with the good smooth wheels ... so 1 can take our clothes to the river for a washing? Lovely things, but lying before me all soiled. And you yourself, sitting among the princes, debating points at your council, you really should be wearing spotless linen. Then you have five sons, full-grown in the palace, two of them married, but three are lusty bachelors always demanding crisp shirts fresh from the wash when they go out to dance. Look at my duties — that all rests on me. " So she coaxed, too shy to touch on her hopes for marriage, young warm hopes, in her father's presence. But he saw through it all and answered quickly, "1 won't deny you the mules, my darling girl ... 1 won't deny you anything. Off you go, and the men will harness a wagon, the tall one with the good smooth wheels, fitted out with a cradle on the top." With that he called to the stablemen and they complied. They trundled the wagon out now, rolling smoothly, backed the mule-team into the traces, hitched them up, while the princess brought her finery from the room and piled it into the wagon's polished cradle. Her mother packed a hamper — treats of all kinds, favorite things to refresh her daughter's spirits — poured wine in a skin, and as Nausicaa climbed aboard, the queen gave her a golden flask of suppling olive oil for her and her maids to smooth on after bathing. Then, taking the whip in hand and glistening reins, she touched the mules to a start and out they clattered, trotting on at a clip, bearing the princess and her clothes and not alone: her maids went with her, stepping briskly too. Once they reached the banks of the river flowing strong where the pools would never fail, with plenty of water cool and clear, bubbling up and rushing through to scour the darkest stains — they loosed the mules, out from under the wagon yoke, and chased them down the river's rippling banks to graze on luscious clover. Down from the cradle they lifted clothes by the armload, plunged them into the dark pools and stamped them down in the hollows, one girl racing the next to finish first until they'd scoured and rinsed off all the grime, then they spread them out in a line along the beach where the surf had washed a pebbly scree ashore. And once they'd bathed and smoothed their skin with oil, they took their picnic, sitting along the river's banks and waiting for all the clothes to dry in the hot noon sun. Now fed to their hearts' content, the princess and her retinue threw their veils to the wind, struck up a game of ball. White-armed Nausicaa led their singing, dancing beat ... as lithe as Artemis with her arrows striding down from a high peak — ^Taygetus' towering ridge or Erymanthus — thrilled to race with the wild boar or bounding deer, and nymphs of the hills race with her, daughters of Zeus whose shield is storm and thunder, ranging the hills in sport, and Leto's heart exults as head and shoulders over the rest her daughter rises, unmistakable — she outshines them all, though all are lovely. So Nausicaa shone among her maids, a virgin, still unwed. But now, as she was about to fold her clothes and yoke the mules and turn for home again, now clear-eyed Pallas thought of what came next, to make Odysseus wake and see this young beauty and she would lead him to the Phaeacians' town. The ball— the princess suddenly tossed it to a maid but it missed the girl, splashed in a deep swirling pool and they all shouted out — and that woke great Odysseus. He sat up with a start, puzzling, his heart pounding: "Man of misery, whose land have 1 lit on now? What arethey here — violent, savage, lawless? or friendly to strangers, god-fearing men? Listen: shouting, echoing round me — ^women, girls — or the nymphs who haunt the rugged mountaintops and the river springs and meadows lush with grass! Or am 1 really close to people who speak my language? Up with you, see how the land lies, see for yourself now ..." Muttering so, great Odysseus crept out of the bushes, stripping off with his massive hand a leafy branch from the tangled olive growth to shield his body, hide his private parts. And out he stalked as a mountain lion exultant in his power strides through wind and rain and his eyes blaze and he charges sheep or oxen or chases wild deer but his hunger drives him on to go for flocks, even to raid the best-defended homestead. So Odysseus moved out ... about to mingle with all those lovely girls, naked now as he was, for the need drove him on, a terrible sight, all crusted, caked with brine — they scattered in panic down the jutting beaches. Only Alcinous' daughter held fast, for Athena planted courage within her heart, dissolved the trembling in her limbs, and she firmly stood her ground and faced Odysseus, torn now — Should he fling his arms around her knees, the young beauty, plead for help, or stand back, plead with a winning word, beg her to lead him to the town and lend him clothing? This was the better way, he thought. Plead now with a subtle, winning word and stand well back, don't clasp her knees, the girl might bridle, yes. He launched in at once, endearing, sly and suave: "Here 1 am at your mercy, princess — are you a goddess or a mortal? If one of the gods who rule the skies up there, you're Artemis to the life, the daughter of mighty Zeus — 1 see her now— just look at your build, your bearing, your lithe flowing grace ... But if you're one of the mortals living here on earth, three times blest are your father, your queenly mother, three times over your brothers too. How often their hearts must warm with joy to see you striding into the dances — such a bloom of beauty. True, but lie is the one more blest than all other men alive, that man who sways you with gifts and leads you home, his bride! 1 have never laid eyes on anyone like you, neither man nor woman ... 1 look at you and a sense of wonder takes me. Wait, once 1 saw the like — in Delos, beside Apollo's altar — the young slip of a palm-tree springing into the light. There I'd sailed, you see, with a great army in my wake, out on the long campaign that doomed my life to hardship. That vision! Just as 1 stood there gazing, rapt, for hours ... no shaft like that had ever risen up from the earth — so now 1 marvel at you, my lady: rapt, enthralled, too struck with awe to grasp you by the knees though pain has ground me down. Only yesterday, the twentieth day, did 1 escape the wine-dark sea. Till then the waves and the rushing gales had swept me on from the island of Ogygia. Now some power has tossed me here, doubtless to suffer still more torments on your shores. I can't believe they 'll stop. Long before that the gods will give me more, still more. Compassion — princess, please! You, after all that 1 have suffered, you are the first I've come to. 1 know no one else, none in your city, no one in your land. Show me the way to town, give me a rag for cover, just some cloth, some wrapper you carried with you here. And may the good gods give you all your heart desires: husband, and house, and lasting harmony too. No finer, greater gift in the world than that ... when man and woman possess their home, two minds, two hearts that work as one. Despair to their enemies, joy to all their friends. Their own best claim to glory. ' "Stranger," the white-armed princess answered staunchly, "friend, you're hardly a wicked man, and no fool, I'd say — it's Olympian Zeus himself who hands our fortunes out, to each of us in turn, to the good and bad, however Zeus prefers ... He gave you pain, it seems. You simply have to bear it. But now, seeing you've reached our city and our land, you'll never lack for clothing or any other gift, the right of worn-out suppliants come our way. I'll show you our town, tell you our people's name. Phaeacians we are, who hold this city and this land, and 1 am the daughter of generous King Alcinous. All our people's power stems from him." She called out to her girls with lovely braids: "Stop, my friends! Why run when you see a man? Surely you don't think him an enemy, do you? There's no one alive, there never will be one, who'd reach Phaeacian soil and lay it waste. The immortals love us far too much for that. We live too far apart, out in the surging sea, off at the world's end — no other mortals come to mingle with us. But here's an unlucky wanderer strayed our way and we must tend him well. Every stranger and beggar comes from Zeus, and whatever scrap we give him he'll be glad to get. So, quick, my girls, give our newfound friend some food and drink and bathe the man in the river, wherever you find some shelter from the wind." At that they came to a halt and teased each other on and led Odysseus down to a sheltered spot where he could find a seat, just as great Alcinous' daughter told them. They laid out cloak and shirt for him to wear, they gave him the golden flask of suppling olive oil and pressed him to bathe himself in the river's stream. Then thoughtful Odysseus reassured the handmaids, "Stand where you are, dear girls, a good way off, so 1 can rinse the brine from my shoulders now and rub myself with oil ... how long it's been since oil touched my skin! But 1 won't bathe in front of you. 1 would be embarrassed — stark naked before young girls with lovely braids." The handmaids scurried off to tell their mistress. Great Odysseus bathed in the river, scrubbed his body clean of brine that clung to his back and broad shoulders, scoured away the brackish scurf that caked his head. And then, once he had bathed all over, rubbed in oil and donned the clothes the virgin princess gave him, Zeus's daughter Athena made him taller to all eyes, his build more massive now, and down from his brow she ran his curls like thick hyacinth clusters full of blooms. As a master craftsman washes gold over beaten silver — a man the god of fire and Queen Athena trained in every fine technique — and finishes off his latest effort, handsome work, so she lavished splendor over his head and shoulders now. And down to the beach he walked and sat apart. glistening in his glory, breathtaking, yes, and the princess gazed in wonder ... then turned to her maids with lovely braided hair: "Listen, my white-armed girls, to what 1 tell you. The gods of Olympus can't be all against this man who's come to mingle among our noble people. At first he seemed appalling, 1 must say — now he seems like a god who rules the skies up there! Ah, if only a man like tJlat^Nere called my husband, lived right here, pleased to stay forever ... Enough. Give the stranger food and drink, my girls." They hung on her words and did her will at once, set before Odysseus food and drink, and he ate and drank, the great Odysseus, long deprived, so ravenous now — it seemed like years since he had tasted food. The white-armed princess thought of one last thing. Folding the clothes, she packed them into her painted wagon, hitched the sharp-hoofed mules, and climbing up herself, Nausicaa urged Odysseus, warmly urged her guest, "Up with you now, my friend, and off to town we go. I'll see you into my wise father's palace where, 1 promise you, you'll meet all the best Phaeacians. Wait, let's do it this way. You seem no fool to me. While we're passing along the fields and plowlands, you follow the mules and wagon, stepping briskly with all my maids. I'll lead the way myself. But once we reach our city, ringed by walls and strong high towers too, with a fine harbor either side ... and the causeway in is narrow; along the road the rolling ships are all hauled up, with a slipway cleared for every vessel. There's our assembly, round Poseidon's royal precinct, built of quarried slabs planted deep in the earth. Here the sailors tend their black ships' tackle, cables and sails, and plane their oarblades down. Phaeacians, you see, care nothing for bow or quiver. only for masts and oars and good trim ships themselves — we glory in our ships, crossing the foaming seas! But 1 shrink from all our sea-dogs' nasty gossip. Some old salt might mock us behind our backs — we have our share of insolent types in town and one of the coarser sort, spying us, might say, 'Now who's that tall, handsome stranger Nausicaa has in tow? Where'd she light on himPHer husband-to-be, just wait! But who — some shipwrecked stray she's taken up with, some alien from abroad? Since nobody lives nearby. Unless it's really a god come down from the blue to answer all her prayers, and to have her all his days. Good riddance! Let the girl go roving to find herself a man from foreign parts. She only spurns her own — countless Phaeacians round about who court her, nothing but our best. ' So they'll scoff... just think of the scandal that would face me then. I'd find fault with a girl who carried on that way, flouting her parents' wishes — father, mother, still alive — consorting with men before she'd tied the knot in public. No, stranger, listen closely to what 1 say, the sooner to win your swift voyage home at my father's hands. Now, you'll find a splendid grove along the road — poplars, sacred to Pallas — a bubbling spring's inside and meadows run around it. There lies my father's estate, his blooming orchard too, as far from town as a man's strong shout can carry. Take a seat there, wait a while, and give us time to make it into town and reach my father's house. Then, when you think we're home, walk on yourself to the city, ask the way to my father's palace, generous King Alcinous. You cannot miss it, even an innocent child could guide you there. No other Phaeacian's house is built like that: so grand, the palace of Alcinous, our great hero. Once the mansion and courtyard have enclosed you, go, quickly, across the hall until you reach my mother. Beside the hearth she sits in the fire's glare, spinning yarn on a spindle, sea-blue wool — a stirring sight, you'll see ... she leans against a pillar, her ladies sit behind. And my father's throne is drawn up close beside her; there he sits and takes his wine, a mortal like a god. Go past him, grasp my mother's knees — if you want to see the day of your return, rejoicing, soon, even if your home's a world away. If only the queen will take you to her heart, then there's hope that you will see your loved ones, reach your own grand house, your native land at last." At that she touched the mules with her shining whip and they quickly left the running stream behind. The team trotted on, their hoofs wove in and out. She drove them back with care so all the rest, maids and Odysseus, could keep the pace on foot, and she used the whip discreetly. The sun sank as they reached the hallowed grove, sacred to Athena, where Odysseus stopped and sat and said a prayer at once to mighty Zeus's daughter: "Hear me, daughter of Zeus whose shield is thunder — tireless one, Athena! Now hear my prayer at last, for you never heard me then, when 1 was shattered, when the famous god of earthquakes wrecked my craft. Grant that here among the Phaeacian people 1 may find some mercy and some love!" So he prayed and Athena heard his prayer but would not yet appear to him undisguised. She stood in awe of her Father's brother, lord of the sea who still seethed on, still churning with rage against the great Odysseus till he reached his native land. Phaeacia's Halls and Gardens Now as Odysseus, long an exile, prayed in Athena's grove, the hardy mule-team drew the princess toward the city. Reaching her father's splendid halls, she reined in, just at the gates — her brothers clustering round her, men like gods, released the mules from the yoke and brought the clothes indoors as Nausicaa made her way toward her bedroom. There her chambermaid lit a fire for her — Eury medusa, the old woman who'd come from Apiraea years ago, when the rolling ships had sailed her in and the country picked her out as King Alcinous' prize, for he ruled all the Phaeacians, they obeyed him like a god. Once, she had nursed the white-armed princess in the palace. Now she lit a fire and made her supper in the room. At the same time, Odysseus set off toward the city. Pallas Athena, harboring kindness for the hero, drifted a heavy mist around him, shielding him from any swaggering islander who'd cross his path, provoke him with taunts and search out who he was. Instead, as he was about to enter the welcome city, the bright-eyed goddess herself came up to greet him there, for all the world like a young girl, holding a pitcher, standing face-to-face with the visitor, who asked, "Little girl, now wouldn't you be my guide to the palace of the one they call Alcinous? The king who rules the people of these parts. 1 am a stranger, you see, weighed down with troubles, come this way from a distant, far-off shore. So 1 know no one here, none at all in your city and the farmlands round about. " "Oh yes, sir, good old stranger," the bright-eyed goddess said, "I'll show you the very palace that you're after — the king lives right beside my noble father. Come, quietly too, and 1 will lead the way. Now not a glance at anyone, not a question. The men here never suffer strangers gladly, have no love for hosting a man from foreign lands. All they really trust are their fast, flying ships that cross the mighty ocean. Gifts of Poseidon, ah what ships they are — quick as a bird, quick as a darting thought!" And Pallas Athena sped away in the lead as he followed in her footsteps, man and goddess. But the famed Phaeacian sailors never saw him, right in their midst, striding down their streets. Athena the one with lovely braids would not permit it, the awesome goddess poured an enchanted mist around him, harboring kindness for Odysseus in her heart. And he marveled now at the balanced ships and havens, the meeting grounds of the great lords and the long ramparts looming, coped and crowned with palisades of stakes — an amazing sight to see ... And once they reached the king's resplendent halls the bright-eyed goddess cried out, "Good old stranger, here, here is the very palace that you're after — I've pointed you all the way. Here you'll find our princes dear to the gods, busy feasting. You go on inside. Be bold, nothing to fear. In every venture the bold man comes off best, even the wanderer, bound from distant shores. The queen is the first you'll light on in the halls. Arete, she is called, and earns the name: she answers all our prayers. She comes, in fact, from the same stock that bred our King Alcinous. First came Nausithous, son of the earthquake god Poseidon and Periboea, the lovely, matchless beauty, the youngest daughter of iron- willed Eurymedon, king of the overweening Giants years ago. He led that reckless clan to its own ruin, killed himself in the bargain, but the Sea-lord lay in love with Periboea and she produced a son, Nausithous, that lionheart who ruled Phaeacia well. Now, Nausithous had two sons, Rhexenor and Alcinous, but the lord of the silver bow, Apollo, shot Rhexenor down — married, true, yet still without a son in the halls, he left one child behind, a daughter named Arete. Alcinous made the girl his wife and honors her as no woman is honored on this earth, of all the wives now keeping households under their husbands' sway. Such is her pride of place, and always will be so: dear to her loving children, to Alcinous himself and all our people. They gaze on Jier as a god, saluting her warmly on her walks through town. She lacks nothing in good sense and judgment — she can dissolve quarrels, even among men, whoever wins her sympathies. If only our queen will take you to her heart, then there's hope that you will see your loved ones, reach your high-roofed house, your native land at last." And with that vow the bright-eyed goddess sped away, over the barren sea, leaving welcome Scheria far behind, and reaching Marathon and the spacious streets of Athens, entered Erechtheus' sturdy halls, Athena's stronghold. Now as Odysseus approached Alcinous' famous house a rush of feelings stirred within his heart, bringing him to a standstill, even before he crossed the bronze threshold ... A radiance strong as the moon or rising sun came flooding through the high-roofed halls of generous King Alcinous. Walls plated in bronze, crowned with a circling frieze glazed as blue as lapis, ran to left and right from outer gates to the deepest court recess. Solid golden doors enclosed the palace. Up from the bronze threshold silver doorposts rose with silver lintel above, and golden handle hooks. And dogs of gold and silver were stationed either side, forged by the god of fire with all his cunning craft to keep watch on generous King Alcinous' palace now, his immortal guard-dogs, ageless, all their days. Inside to left and right, in a long unbroken row from farthest outer gate to the inmost chamber, thrones stood backed against the wall, each draped with a finely spun brocade, women's handsome work. Here the Phaeacian lords would sit enthroned, dining, drinking — ^the feast flowed on forever. And young boys, molded of gold, set on pedestals standing firm, were lifting torches high in their hands to flare through the nights and light the feasters down the hall. And Alcinous has some fifty serving-women in his house: some, turning the handmill, grind the apple-yellow grain, some weave at their webs or sit and spin their yarn, fingers flickering quick as aspen leaves in the wind and the densely woven woolens dripping oil droplets. Just as Phaeacian men excel the world at sailing, driving their swift ships on the open seas, so the women excel at all the arts of weaving. That is Athena's gift to them beyond all others — a genius for lovely work, and a fine mind too. Outside the courtyard, fronting the high gates, a magnificent orchard stretches four acres deep with a strong fence running round it side-to-side. Here luxuriant trees are always in their prime, pomegranates and pears, and apples glowing red, succulent figs and olives swelling sleek and dark. And the yield of all these trees will never flag or die, neither in winter nor in summer, a harvest all year round for the West Wind always breathing through will bring some fruits to the bud and others warm to ripeness — pear mellowing ripe on pear, apple on apple, cluster of grapes on cluster, fig crowding fig. And here is a teeming vineyard planted for the kings, beyond it an open level bank where the vintage grapes lie baking to raisins in the sun while pickers gather others; some they trample down in vats, and here in the front rows bunches of unripe grapes have hardly shed their blooms while others under the sunlight slowly darken purple. And there by the last rows are beds of greens, bordered and plotted, greens of every kind, glistening fresh, year in, year out. And last, there are two springs, one rippling in channels over the whole orchard — ^the other, flanking it, rushes under the palace gates to bubble up in front of the lofty roofs where the city people come and draw their water. Such the gifts, the glories showered down by the gods on King Alcinous' realm. And there Odysseus stood, gazing at all this bounty, a man who'd borne so much ... Once he'd had his fill of marveling at it all. he crossed the threshold quickly, strode inside the palace. Here he found the Phaeacian lords and captains tipping out libations now to the guide and giant-killer Hermes, the god to whom they would always pour the final cup before they sought their beds. Odysseus went on striding down the hall, the man of many struggles shrouded still in the mist Athena drifted round him, till he reached Arete and Alcinous the king. And then, the moment he flung his arms around Arete s knees, the godsent mist rolled back to reveal the great man. And silence seized the feasters all along the hall — seeing him right before their eyes, they marveled, gazing on him now as Odysseus pleaded, "Queen, Arete, daughter of godlike King Rhexenor! Here after many trials 1 come to beg for mercy, your husband's, yours, and all these feasters' here. May the gods endow them with fortune all their lives, may each hand down to his sons the riches in his house and the pride of place the realm has granted him. But as for myself, grant me a rapid convoy home to my own native land. How far away I've been from all my loved ones — how long 1 have suffered!" Pleading so, the man sank down in the ashes, just at the hearth beside the blazing fire, while all the rest stayed hushed, stock-still. At last the old revered Echeneus broke the spell, the eldest lord in Phaeacia, finest speaker too, a past master at all the island's ancient ways. Impelled by kindness now, he rose and said, "This is no way, Alcinous. How indecent, look, our guest on the ground, in the ashes by the fire! Your people are holding back, waiting for your signal. Come, raise him up and seat the stranger now, in a silver-studded chair, and tell the heralds to mix more wine for all so we can pour out cups to Zeus who loves the lightning. champion of suppliants — suppliants' rights are sacred. And let the housekeeper give our guest his supper, unstinting with her stores." Hearing that, Alcinous, poised in all his majesty, took the hand of the seasoned, worldly-wise Odysseus, raised him up from the hearth and sat him down in a burnished chair, displacing his own son, the courtly Lord Laodamas who had sat beside him, the son he loved the most. A maid brought water soon in a graceful golden pitcher and over a silver basin tipped it out so the guest might rinse his hands, then pulled a gleaming table to his side. A staid housekeeper brought on bread to serve him, appetizers aplenty too, lavish with her bounty. As long-suffering great Odysseus ate and drank, the hallowed King Alcinous called his herald: "Come, Pontonous! Mix the wine in the bowl, pour rounds to all our banqueters in the house so we can pour out cups to Zeus who loves the lightning, champion of suppliants — suppliants' rights are sacred." At that Pontonous mixed the heady, honeyed wine and tipped first drops for the god in every cup, then poured full rounds for all. And once they'd poured libations out and drunk to their hearts' content, Alcinous rose and addressed his island people: "Hear me, lords and captains of Phaeacia, hear what the heart inside me has to say. Now, our feast finished, home you go to sleep. But at dawn we call the elders in to full assembly, host our guest in the palace, sacrifice to the gods and then we turn our minds to his passage home, so under our convoy our new friend can travel back to his own land — no toil, no troubles — soon, rejoicing, even if his home's a world away. And on the way no pain or hardship suffered, not till he sets foot on native ground again. There in the future he must suffer all that Fate and the overbearing Spinners spun out on his life line the very day his mother gave him birth ... But if he's one of the deathless powers, out of the blue, the gods are working now in strange, new ways. Always, up to now, they came to us face-to-face whenever we'd give them grand, glorious sacrifices — they always sat beside us here and shared our feasts. Even when some lonely traveler meets them on the roads, they never disguise themselves. We're too close kin for that, close as the wild Giants are, the Cyclops too. " "Alcinous!" wary Odysseus countered, "cross that thought from your mind. I'm nothing like the immortal gods who rule the skies, either in build or breeding. I'm just a mortal man. Whom do you know most saddled down with sorrow? They are the ones I'd equal, grief for grief. And 1 could tell a tale of still more hardship, all I've suffered, thanks to the gods' will. But despite my misery, let me finish dinner. The belly's a shameless dog, there's nothing worse. Always insisting, pressing, it never lets us forget — destroyed as 1 am, my heart racked with sadness, sick with anguish, still it keeps demanding, 'Eat, drink!' It blots out all the memory of my pain, commanding, 'Fill me up!' But you, at the first light of day, hurry, please, to set your unlucky guest on his own home soil. How much 1 have suffered ... Oh just let me see my lands, my serving-men and the grand high-roofed house — then 1 can die in peace." All burst into applause, urging passage home for their newfound friend, his pleading rang so true. And once they 'd poured libations out and drunk to their hearts' content, each one made his way to rest in his own house. But King Odysseus still remained at hall, seated beside the royal Alcinous and Arete as servants cleared the cups and plates away. The white-armed Queen Arete took the lead; she'd spotted the cape and shirt Odysseus wore, fine clothes she'd made herself with all her women, so now her words flew brusquely, sharply: "Stranger, I'll be the first to question you — myself. Who are you? Where are you from? Who gave you the clothes you're wearing now? Didn't you say you reached us roving on the sea? " "What hard labor, queen, " the man of craft replied, "to tell you the story of my troubles start to finish. The gods on high have given me my share. Still, this much 1 will tell you ... seeing you probe and press me so intently. There is an island, Ogygia, lying far at sea, where the daughter of Atlas, Calypso, has her home, the seductive nymph with lovely braids — a danger too, and no one, god or mortal, dares approach her there. But 1, cursed as 1 am, some power brought me to her hearth, alone, when Zeus with a white-hot bolt had crushed my racing warship down the wine-dark sea. There all the rest of my loyal shipmates died but 1, locking my arms around my good ship's keel, drifted along nine days. On the tenth, at dead of night, the gods cast me up on Ogygia, Calypso's island, home of the dangerous nymph with glossy braids, and the goddess took me in in all her kindness, welcomed me warmly, cherished me, even vowed to make me immortal, ageless, all my days — but she never won the heart inside me, never. Seven endless years 1 remained there, always drenching with my tears the immortal clothes Calypso gave me. Then, at last, when the eighth came wheeling round, she insisted that 1 sail — inspired by warnings sent from Zeus, perhaps, or her own mind had changed. She saw me on my way in a solid craft, tight and trim, and gave me full provisions, food and mellow wine, immortal clothes to wear and summoned a wind to bear me onward, fair and warm. And seventeen days 1 sailed, making headway well; on the eighteenth, shadowy mountains slowly loomed ... your land! My heart leapt up, unlucky as 1 am, doomed to be comrade still to many hardships. Many pains the god of earthquakes piled upon me, loosing the winds against me, blocking passage through, heaving up a terrific sea, beyond belief — nor did the whitecaps let me cling to my craft, for all my desperate groaning. No, the squalls shattered her stem to stern, but 1, 1 swam hard, 1 plowed my way through those dark gulfs till at last the wind and current bore me to your shores. But here, had 1 tried to land, the breakers would have hurled me, smashed me against the jagged cliffs of that grim coast, so 1 pulled away, swam back till 1 reached a river, the perfect spot at last, or so it struck me, free of rocks, with a windbreak from the gales. So, fighting for life, 1 flung myself ashore and the godsent, bracing night came on at once. Clambering up from the river, big with Zeus's rains, 1 bedded down in the brush, my body heaped with leaves, and a god poured down a boundless sleep upon me, yes, and there in the leaves, exhausted, sick at heart, 1 slept the whole night through and on to the break of day and on into high noon and the sun was wheeling down when sweet sleep set me free. And 1 looked up, and there were your daughter's maids at play on the beach, and she, she moved among them like a deathless goddess! 1 begged her for help and not once did her sense of tact desert her; she behaved as you'd never hope to find in one so young, not in a random meeting — time and again the youngsters prove so flighty. Not she. She gave me food aplenty and shining wine. a bath in the river too, and gave me all this clothing. That's my whole story. Wrenching to tell, but true." "Ah, but in one regard, my friend," the king replied, "her good sense missed the mark, this daughter of mine. She never escorted you to our house with all her maids but sAe^Nas the first you asked for care and shelter." "Your majesty," diplomatic Odysseus answered, "don't find fault with a flawless daughter now, not for my sake, please. She urged me herself to follow with her maids. 1 chose not to, fearing embarrassment in fact — what if you took offense, seeing us both together? Suspicious we are, we men who walk the earth." "Oh no, my friend," Alcinous stated flatly, "I'm hardly a man for reckless, idle anger. Balance is best in all things. Father Zeus, Athena and lord Apollo! if only — seeing the man you are, seeing we think as one — you could wed my daughter and be my son-in-law and stay right here with us. I'd give you a house and great wealth — if you chose to stay, that is. No Phaeacian would hold you back by force. The curse of Father Zeus on such a thing! And about your convoy home, you rest assured: 1 have chosen the day and 1 decree it is tomorrow. And all that voyage long you'll lie in a deep sleep while my people sail you on through calm and gentle tides till you reach your land and house, or any place you please. True, even if landfall lies more distant than Euboea, off at the edge of the world ... So say our crews, at least, who saw it once, that time they carried the gold-haired Rhadamanthys out to visit Tity us, son of Mother Earth. Imagine, there they sailed and back they came in the same day, they finished the homeward run with no strain at all. You'll see for yourself how far they top the best — my ships and their young shipmates tossing up the whitecaps with their oars!" So he vowed and the Jong-enduring great Odysseus glowed with joy and raised a prayer and called the god by name: "Father Zeus on high — may the king fulfill his promises one and all! Then his fame would ring through the fertile earth and never die — and 1 should reach my native land at last!" And now as the two men exchanged their hopes, the white-armed queen instructed her palace maids to make a bed in the porch's shelter, lay down some heavy purple throws for the bed itself, and over it spread some blankets, thick woolly robes, a warm covering laid on top. Torches in hand, they left the hall and fell to work at once, briskly prepared a good snug resting-place and then returned to Odysseus, urged the guest, "Up, friend, time for sleep. Your bed is made." How welcome the thought of sleep to that man now ... So there after many trials Odysseus lay at rest on a corded bed inside the echoing colonnade. Alcinous slept in chambers deep in his lofty house where the queen his wife arranged and shared their bed. A Day for Songs and Contests when young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more royal Alcinous, hallowed island king, rose from bed and great Odysseus, raider of cities, rose too. Poised in his majesty, Alcinous led the way to Phaeacia's meeting grounds, built for all beside the harbored ships. Both men sat down on the polished stone benches side-by-side as Athena started roaming up and down the town, in build and voice the wise Alcinous' herald, furthering plans for Odysseus' journey home, and stopped beside each citizen, urged them all, "Come this way, you lords and captains of Phaeacia, come to the meeting grounds and learn about the stranger! A new arrival! Here at our wise king's palace now, he's here from roving the ocean, driven far off course — he looks like a deathless god!" Rousing their zeal, their curiosity, each and every man, and soon enough the assembly seats were filled with people thronging, gazing in wonder at the seasoned man of war ... Over Odysseus' head and shoulders now Athena lavished a marvelous splendor, yes, making him taller, more massive to all eyes, so Phaeacians might regard the man with kindness, awe and respect as well, and he might win through the many trials they 'd pose to test the hero's strength. Once they'd grouped, crowding the meeting grounds, Alcinous rose and addressed his island people: "Hear me, lords and captains of Phaeacia, hear what the heart inside me has to say. This stranger here, our guest — 1 don't know who he is, or whether he comes from sunrise lands or the western lands of evening, but he has come in his wanderings to my palace; he pleads for passage, he begs we guarantee it. So now, as in years gone by, let us press on and grant him escort. No one, 1 tell you, no one who comes to my house will languish long here, heartsick for convoy home. Come, my people! Haul a black ship down to the bright sea, rigged for her maiden voyage — enlist a crew of fifty -two young sailors, the best in town, who've proved their strength before. Let all hands lash their oars to the thwarts then disembark, come to my house and fall in for a banquet, quickly. I'll lay on a princely feast for all. So then, these are the orders 1 issue to our crews. For the rest, you sceptered princes here, you come to my royal halls so we can give this stranger a hero's welcome in our palace — no one here refuse. Call in the inspired bard Demodocus. God has given the man the gift of song. to him beyond all others, the power to please, however the spirit stirs him on to sing." With those commands Alcinous led the way and a file of sceptered princes took his lead, while the herald went to find the gifted bard. And the fifty -two young sailors, duly chosen, briskly following orders, went down to the shore of the barren salt sea. And once they reached the ship at the surf 's edge, first they hauled the craft into deeper water, stepped the mast amidships, canvas brailed, they made oars fast in the leather oarlock straps, moored her riding high on the swell, then disembarked and made their way to wise Alcinous' high-roofed halls. There colonnades and courts and rooms were overflowing with crowds, a mounting host of people young and old. The king slaughtered a dozen sheep to feed his guests, eight boars with shining tusks and a pair of shambling oxen. These they skinned and dressed, and then laid out a feast to fill the heart with savor. In came the herald now, leading along the faithful bard the Muse adored above all others, true, but her gifts were mixed with good and evil both: she stripped him of sight but gave the man the power of stirring, rapturous song. Pontonous brought the bard a silver-studded chair, right amid the feasters, leaning it up against a central column — hung his high clear lyre on a peg above his head and showed him how to reach up with his hands and lift it down. And the herald placed a table by his side with a basket full of bread and cup of wine for him to sip when his spirit craved refreshment. All reached out for the good things that lay at hand and when they 'd put aside desire for food and drink, the Muse inspired the bard to sing the famous deeds of fighting heroes — the song whose fame had reached the skies those days: The Strife Between Odysseus and Achilles, Peleus' Son ... how once at the gods' flowing feast the captains clashed in a savage war of words, while Agamemnon, lord of armies, rejoiced at heart that Achaea's bravest men were battling so. For this was the victory sign that Apollo prophesied at his shrine in Py tho when Agamemnon strode across the rocky threshold, asking the oracle for advice — the start of the tidal waves of ruin tumbling down on Troy 's and Achaea's forces, both at once, thanks to the will of Zeus who rules the world. That was the song the famous harper sang but Odysseus, clutching his flaring sea-blue cape in both powerful hands, drew it over his head and buried his handsome face, ashamed his hosts might see him shedding tears. Whenever the rapt bard would pause in the song, he'd lift the cape from his head, wipe off his tears and hoisting his double-handled cup, pour it out to the gods. But soon as the bard would start again, impelled to sing by Phaeacia's lords, who reveled in his tale, again Odysseus hid his face and wept. His weeping went unmarked by all the others; only Alcinous, sitting close beside him, noticed his guest's tears, heard the groan in the man's labored breathing and said at once to the master mariners around him, "Hear me, my lords and captains of Phaeacia! By now we've had our fill of food well-shared and the lyre too, our loyal friend at banquets. Now out we go again and test ourselves in contests, games of every kind — so our guest can tell his friends, when he reaches home, how far we excel the world at boxing, wrestling, jumping, speed of foot." He forged ahead and the rest fell in behind. The herald hung the ringing lyre back on its peg and taking Demodocus by the hand, led him from the palace, guiding him down the same path the island lords had just pursued, keen to watch the contests. They reached the meeting grounds with throngs of people streaming in their trail as a press of young champions rose for competition. Topsail and Riptide rose, the helmsman Rowhard too and Seaman and Sternman, Surf-at-the-Beach and Stroke-Oar, Breaker and Bowsprit, Racing-the-Wind and Swing-Aboard and Seagirt the son of Greatfleet, Shipwrightson and the son of Launcher, Broadsea, rose up too, a match for murderous Ares, death to men — in looks and build the best of all Phaeacians after gallant Laodamas, the Captain of the People. Laodamas rose with two more sons of great Alcinous, Halius bred to the sea and Cly toneus famed for ships. And now the games began, the first event a footrace ... They toed the line — and broke flat out from the start with a fast pack flying down the field in a whirl of dust and Cly toneus the prince outstripped them all by far, flashing ahead the length two mules will plow a furrow before he turned for home, leaving the pack behind and raced to reach the crowds. Next the wrestling, grueling sport. They grappled, locked, and Broadsea, pinning the strongest champions, won the bouts. Next, in the jumping. Seagirt leapt and beat the field. In the discus Rowhard up and outhurled them all by far. And the king's good son Laodamas boxed them to their knees. When all had enjoyed the games to their hearts' content Alcinous' son Laodamas spurred them: "Come, my friends, let's ask our guest if he knows the ropes of any sport. He's no mean man, not with a build like that ... Look at his thighs, his legs, and what a pair of arms — his massive neck, his big, rippling strength! Nor is he past his prime, just beaten down by one too many blows. Nothing worse than the sea, I always say, to crush a man, the strongest man ahve. " And Broadsea put in quickly, "Well said, Laodamas, right to the point. Go up to the fellow, challenge him yourself. " On that cue, the noble prince strode up before Odysseus, front and center, asking, "Come, stranger, sir, won't you try your hand at our contests now? If you have skill in any. It's fit and proper for you to know your sports. What greater glory attends a man, while he's alive, than what he wins with his racing feet and striving hands? Come and compete then, throw your cares to the wind! It won't be long, your journey's not far off — your ship's already hauled down to the sea, your crew is set to sail." "Laodamas," quick to the mark Odysseus countered sharply, "why do you taunt me so with such a challenge? Pains weigh on my spirit now, not your sports — I've suffered much already, struggled hard. But here 1 sit amid your assembly still, starved for passage home, begging your king, begging all your people." "Oh 1 knew it!" Broadsea broke in, mocking him to his face. "1 never took you for someone skilled in games, the kind that real men play throughout the world. Not a chance. You're some skipper of profiteers, roving the high seas in his scudding craft, reckoning up his freight with a keen eye out for home-cargo, grabbing the gold he can! You're no athlete. 1 see that." With a dark glance wily Odysseus shot back, "Indecent talk, my friend. You, you're a reckless fool — 1 see that. So, the gods don't hand out all their gifts at once, not build and brains and flowing speech to all. One man may fail to impress us with his looks but a god can crown his words with beauty, charm, and men look on with delight when he speaks out. Never faltering, filled with winning self-control, he shines forth at assembly grounds and people gaze at him like a god when /?£• walks through the streets. Another man may look like a deathless one on high but there's not a bit of grace to crown his words. Just like you, my fine, handsome friend. Not even a god could improve those lovely looks of yours but the mind inside is worthless. Your slander fans the anger in my heart! I'm no stranger to sports — for all your taunts — I've held my place in the front ranks, 1 tell you, long as 1 could trust to my youth and striving hands. But now I'm wrestled down by pain and hardship, look, I've borne my share of struggles, cleaving my way through wars of men and pounding waves at sea. Nevertheless, despite so many blows, I'll give your games a whirl. Your insults cut to the quick — you rouse my fighting blood!" Up he sprang, cloak and all, and seized a discus, huge and heavy, more weighty by far than those the Phaeacians used to hurl and test each other. Wheeling round, he let loose with his great hand and the stone whirred on — and down to ground they went, those lords of the long oars and master mariners cringing under the rock's onrush, soaring lightly out of his grip, flying away past all the other marks, and Queen Athena, built like a man, staked out the spot and cried with a voice of triumph, "Even a blind man, friend, could find your mark by groping round — it's not mixed up in the crowd, it's far in front! There's nothing to fear in this event — no one can touch you, much less beat your distance!" At that the heart of the long-suffering hero laughed, so glad to find a ready friend in the crowd that, lighter in mood, he challenged all Phaeacia's best: "Now go match that, you young pups, and straightaway I'll hurl you another just as far, 1 swear, or even farther! All the rest of you, anyone with the spine and spirit, step right up and try me — you've incensed me so — at boxing, wrestling, racing; nothing daunts me. Any Phaeacian here except Laodamas himself. The man's my host. Who would fight his friend? He'd have to be good-for-nothing, senseless, yes, to challenge his host and come to grips in games, in a far-off land at that. He'd cut his own legs short. But there are no others I'd deny or think beneath me — I'll take on all contenders, gladly, test them head-to-head! I'm not half bad in the world of games where men compete. Well 1 know how to handle a fine polished bow, the first to hit my man in a mass of enemies, even with rows of comrades pressing near me, taking aim with our shafts to hit our targets. Philoctetes alone outshot me there at Troy when ranks of Achaean archers bent their bows. Of the rest I'd say that 1 outclass them all — men still alive, who eat their bread on earth. But I'd never vie with the men of days gone by, not Heracles, not Eurytus of Oechalia — archers who rivaled immortal powers with their bows. That's why noble Eurytus died a sudden death: no old age, creeping upon him in his halls ... Apollo shot him down, enraged that the man had challenged hJjn, the Archer God. As for spears, 1 can fling a spear as far as the next man wings an arrow! Only at sprinting 1 fear you'd leave me in the dust. I've taken a shameful beating out on heavy seas. no conditioning there on shipboard day by day. My legs have lost their spring. " He finished. All stood silent, hushed. Only Alcinous found a way to answer. "Stranger, friend — nothing you say among us seems ungracious. You simply want to display the gifts you're born with, stung that a youngster marched up to you in the games, mocking, ridiculing your prowess as no one would who had some sense of fit and proper speech. But come now, hear me out, so you can tell our story to other lords as you sit and feast in your own halls someday, your own wife and your children by your side, remembering there our island prowess here: what skills great Zeus has given us as well, down all the years from our fathers' days till now. We're hardly world-class boxers or wrestlers, 1 admit, but we can race like the wind, we're champion sailors too, and always dear to our hearts, the feast, the lyre and dance and changes of fresh clothes, our warm baths and beds. So come — all you Phaeacian masters of the dance — now dance away! So our guest can tell his friends, when he reaches home, how far we excel the world in sailing, nimble footwork, dance and song. Go, someone, quickly, fetch Demodocus now his ringing lyre. It must be hanging somewhere in the palace." At the king's word the herald sprang to his feet and ran to fetch the ringing lyre from the house. And stewards rose, nine in all, picked from the realm to set the stage for contests: masters-at-arms who leveled the dancing-floor to make a fine broad ring. The herald returned and placed the vibrant lyre now in Demodocus' hands, and the bard moved toward the center, flanked by boys in the flush of youth, skilled dancers who stamped the ground with marvelous pulsing steps as Odysseus gazed at their flying, flashing feet, his heart aglow with wonder. A rippling prelude — now the bard struck up an irresistible song: The Love of Ares and Aphrodite Crowned with flowers ... how the two had first made love in Hephaestus' mansion, all in secret. Ares had showered her with gifts and showered Hephaestus' marriage bed with shame but a messenger ran to tell the god of fire — Helios, lord of the sun, who'd spied the couple lost in each other 's arms and making love. Hephaestus, hearing the heart- wounding story, bustled toward his forge, brooding on his revenge — planted the huge anvil on its block and beat out chains, not to be slipped or broken, all to pin the lovers on the spot. This snare the Firegod forged, ablaze with his rage at War, then limped to the room where the bed of love stood firm and round the posts he poured the chains in a sweeping net with streams of others flowing down from the roofbeam, gossamer-fine as spider webs no man could see, not even a blissful god — the Smith had forged a masterwork of guile. Once he'd spun that cunning trap around his bed he feigned a trip to the well-built town of Lemnos, dearest to him by far of all the towns on earth. But the god of battle kept no blind man's watch. As soon as he saw the Master Craftsman leave he plied his golden reins and arrived at once and entered the famous god of fire's mansion, chafing with lust for Aphrodite crowned with flowers. She'd just returned from her father's palace, mighty Zeus, and now she sat in her rooms as Ares strode right in and grasped her hand with a warm, seductive urging: "Quick, my darling, come, let's go to bed and lose ourselves in love! Your husband's away — by now he must be off in the wilds of Lemnos, consorting with his raucous Sintian friends. " So he pressed and her heart raced with joy to sleep with War and off they went to bed and down they lay — and down around them came those cunning chains of the crafty god of fire, showering down now till the couple could not move a limb or lift a finger — then they knew at last: there was no way out, not now. But now the glorious crippled Smith was drawing near ... he'd turned around, miles short of the Lemnos coast, for the Sungod kept Azswatch and told Hephaestus all, so back he rushed to his house, his heart consumed with anguish. Halting there at the gates, seized with savage rage he howled a terrible cry, imploring all the gods, "Father Zeus, look here — the rest of you happy gods who live forever — here is a sight to make you laugh, revolt you too! Just because 1 am crippled, Zeus's daughter Aphrodite will always spurn me and love that devastating Ares, just because of his stunning looks and racer's legs while 1 am a weakling, lame from birth, and who's to blame? Both my parents — ^who else? If only they 'd never bred me! Just look at the two lovers ... crawled inside my bed, locked in each other's arms — ^the sight makes me burn! But 1 doubt they'll want to lie that way much longer, not a moment more — mad as they are for each other. No, they'll soon tire of bedding down together, but then my cunning chains will bind them fast till our Father pays my bride-gifts back in full, all 1 handed Jum for that shameless bitch his daughter, irresistible beauty — all unbridled too!" So Hephaestus wailed as the gods came crowding up to his bronze-floored house. Poseidon god of the earthquake came, and Hermes came, the running god of luck, and the Archer, lord Apollo, while modesty kept each goddess to her mansion. The immortals, givers of all good things, stood at the gates, and uncontrollable laughter burst from the happy gods when they saw the god of fire's subtle, cunning work. One would glance at his neighbor, laughing out. "A bad day for adultery! Slow outstrips the Swift. " "Look how limping Hephaestus conquers War, quickest of all the gods who rule Olympus!" "The cripple wins by craft." "The adulterer, Aewill pay the price!" So the gods would banter among themselves but lord Apollo goaded Hermes on: "Tell me, Quicksilver, giver of all good things — even with those unwieldy shackles wrapped around you, how would you like to bed the golden Aphrodite?" "Oh Apollo, if only!" the giant-killer cried. "Archer, bind me down with triple those endless chains! Let all you gods look on, and all you goddesses too — how I'd love to bed that golden Aphrodite!" A peal of laughter broke from the deathless ones but not Poseidon, not a smile from him; he kept on begging the famous Smith to loose the god of war, pleading, his words flying, "Let him go! 1 guarantee you Ares will pay the price, whatever you ask, Hephaestus, whatever's right in the eyes of all the gods. " But the famous crippled Smith appealed in turn, "God of the earthquake, please don't urge this on me. A pledge for a worthless man is a worthless pledge indeed. What if he slips out of his chains — his debts as well? How could 1 shackle youyNhile all the gods look on?" But the god of earthquakes reassured the Smith, "Look, Hephaestus, if Ares scuttles off and away, squirming out of his debt, I'll pay the fine myself." And the famous crippled Smith complied at last: "Now there's an offer 1 really can't refuse!" With all his force the god of fire loosed the chains and the two lovers, free of the bonds that overwhelmed them so, sprang up and away at once, and the Wargod sped to Thrace while Love with her telltale laughter sped to Paphos, Cyprus Isle, where her grove and scented altar stand. There the Graces bathed and anointed her with oil, ambrosial oil, the bloom that clings to the gods who never die, and swathed her round in gowns to stop the heart ... an ecstasy — a vision. That was the song the famous harper sang and Odysseus retished every note as the islanders, the lords of the long oars and master mariners rejoiced. Next the king asked Halius and Laodamas to dance, the two alone, since none could match that pair. So taking in hand a gleaming sea-blue ball, made by the craftsman Poly bus — arching back, one prince would hurl it toward the shadowy clouds as the other leaping high into the air would catch it quickly, nimbly, before his feet hit ground again. Once they'd vied at throwing the ball straight up, they tossed it back and forth in a blur of hands as they danced across the earth that feeds us all, while boys around the ring stamped out the beat and a splendid rhythmic drumming sound arose, and good Odysseus looked at his host, exclaiming, "King Alcinous, shining among your island people, you boasted Phaeacia's dancers are the best — they prove your point — 1 watch and I'm amazed!" His praises cheered the hallowed island king who spoke at once to the master mariners around him: "Hear me, my lords and captains of Phaeacia, our guest is a man of real taste, I'd say. Come, let's give him the parting gifts a guest deserves. There are twelve peers of the realm who rule our land, thirteen, counting myself. Let each of us contribute a fresh cloak and shirt and a bar of precious gold. Gather the gifts together, hurry, so our guest can have them all in hand when he goes to dine, his spirit filled with joy. As for Broadsea, let him make amends, man-to-man, with his words as well as gifts. His first remarks were hardly fit to hear. " All assented and gave their own commands, each noble sent a page to fetch his gifts. And Broadsea volunteered in turn, obliging: "Great Alcinous, shining among our island people, of course I'll make amends to our newfound friend as you request. I'll give the man this sword. It's solid bronze and the hilt has silver studs, the sheath around it ivory freshly carved. Here's a gift our guest will value highly." He placed the silver-studded sword in Odysseus' hands with a burst of warm words: "Farewell, stranger, sir — if any remark of mine gave you offense, may stormwinds snatch it up and sweep it off! May the gods grant you safe passage home to see your wife — you've been so far from loved ones, suffered so!" Tactful Odysseus answered him in kind: "And a warm farewell to you, too, my friend. May the gods grant you good fortune — may you never miss this sword, this gift you give with such salutes. You've made amends in full." With that he slung the silver-studded sword across his shoulder. As the sun sank, his glittering gifts arrived and proud heralds bore them into the hall where sons of King Alcinous took them over, spread them out before their noble mother's feet — a grand array of gifts. The king in all his majesty led the rest of his peers inside, following in a file and down they sat on rows of high-backed chairs. The king turned to the queen and urged her, "Come, my dear, bring in an elegant chest, the best you have, and lay inside it a fresh cloak and shirt, your own gifts. Then heat a bronze cauldron over the fire, boil water, so once our guest has bathed and reviewed his gifts — all neatly stacked for sailing, gifts our Phaeacian lords have brought him now — he'll feast in peace and hear the harper's songs. And 1 will give him this gorgeous golden cup of mine, so he'll remember Alcinous all his days to come when he pours libations out in his own house to Father Zeus and the other gods on high-" And at that Arete told her serving-women, "Set a great three-legged cauldron over the fire — do it right away!" And hoisting over the blaze a cauldron, filling it brimful with bathing water, they piled fresh logs beneath and lit them quickly. The fire lapped at the vessel's belly, the water warmed. Meanwhile the queen had a polished chest brought forth from an inner room and laid the priceless gifts inside, the clothes and gold the Phaeacian lords had brought, and added her own gifts, a cloak and a fine shirt, and gave her guest instructions quick and clear: "Now look to the lid yourself and bind it fast with a good tight knot, so no one can rob you on your voyage — drifting into a sweet sleep as the black ship sails you home." Hearing that, the storm-tossed man secured the lid straightway, he battened it fast with a swift, intricate knot the lady Circe had taught him long ago. And the housekeeper invited him at once to climb into a waiting tub and bathe — a hot, steaming bath ... what a welcome sight to Odysseus' eyes! He'd been a stranger to comforts such as these since he left the lovely-haired Calypso's house, yet all those years he enjoyed such comforts there, never-ending, as if he were a god ... And now, when maids had washed him, rubbed him down with oil and drawn warm fleece and a shirt around his shoulders, he stepped from the bath to join the nobles at their wine. And there stood Nausicaa as he passed. Beside a column that propped the sturdy roof she paused, endowed by the gods with all her beauty, gazing at Odysseus right before her eyes. Wonderstruck, she hailed her guest with a winning flight of words: "Farewell, my friend! And when you are at home, home in your own land, remember me at times. Mainly to me you owe the gift of life." Odysseus rose to the moment deftly, gently: "Nausicaa, daughter of generous King Alcinous, may Zeus the Thunderer, Hera's husband, grant it so — that 1 travel home and see the dawn of my return- Even at home I'll pray to you as a deathless goddess all my days to come. You saved my life, dear girl." And he went and took his seat beside the king. By now they were serving out the portions, mixing wine, and the herald soon approached, leading the faithful bard Demodocus, prized by all the people — seated him in a chair amid the feasters, leaning it against a central column. At once alert Odysseus carved a strip of loin, rich and crisp with fat, from the white-tusked boar that still had much meat left, and called the herald over: "Here, herald, take this choice cut to Demodocus so he can eat his fill — ^with warm regards from a man who knows what suffering is ... From all who walk the earth our bards deserve esteem and awe, for the Muse herself has taught them paths of song. She loves the breed of harpers." The herald placed the gift in Demodocus' hands and the famous blind bard received it, overjoyed. They reached for the good things that lay outspread and when they 'd put aside desire for food and drink, Odysseus, master of many exploits, praised the singer: "1 respect you, Demodocus, more than any man alive — surely the Muse has taught you, Zeus's daughter, or god Apollo himself. How true to life, all too true ... you sing the Achaeans' fate, all they did and suffered, all they soldiered through, as if you were there yourself or heard from one who was. But come now, shift your ground. Sing of the wooden horse Epeus built with Athena's help, the cunning trap that good Odysseus brought one day to the heights of Troy, filled with fighting men who laid the city waste. Sing thattoT me — true to life as it deserves — and 1 will tell the world at once how freely the Muse gave youXhe gods' own gift of song." Stirred now by the Muse, the bard launched out in a fine blaze of song, starting at just the point where the main Achaean force, setting their camps afire, had boarded the oarswept ships and sailed for home but famed Odysseus' men already crouched in hiding — in the heart of Troy's assembly — dark in that horse the Trojans dragged themselves to the city heights. Now it stood there, looming ... and round its bulk the Trojans sat debating, clashing, days on end. Three plans split their ranks: either to hack open the hollow vault with ruthless bronze or haul it up to the highest ridge and pitch it down the cliffs or let it stand — a glorious offering made to pacify the gods — and that, that final plan, was bound to win the day. For Troy was fated to perish once the city lodged inside her walls the monstrous wooden horse where the prime of Argive power lag in wait with death and slaughter bearing down on Troy. And he sang how troops of Achaeans broke from cover, streaming out of the horse's hollow flanks to plunder Troy — he sang how left and right they ravaged the steep city, sang how Odysseus marched right up to Deiphobus' house like the god of war on attack with diehard Menelaus. There, he sang, Odysseus fought the grimmest fight he had ever braved but he won through at last, thanks to Athena's superhuman power. That was the song the famous harper sang but great Odysseus melted into tears, running down from his eyes to wet his cheeks ... as a woman weeps, her arms flung round her darling husband, a man who fell in battle, fighting for town and townsmen, trying to beat the day of doom from home and children. Seeing the man go down, dying, gasping for breath, she clings for dear life, screams and shrills — but the victors, just behind her, digging spear-butts into her back and shoulders, drag her off in bondage, yoked to hard labor, pain, and the most heartbreaking torment wastes her cheeks. So from Odysseus' eyes ran tears of heartbreak now. But his weeping went unmarked by all the others; only Alcinous, sitting close beside him, noticed his guest's tears, heard the groan in the man's labored breathing and said at once to the master mariners around him, "Hear me, my lords and captains of Phaeacia! Let Demodocus rest his ringing lyre now — this song he sings can hardly please us all. Ever since our meal began and the stirring bard launched his song, our guest has never paused in his tears and throbbing sorrow. Clearly grief has overpowered his heart. Break off this song! Let us a77enjoy ourselves, the hosts and guest together. Much the warmer way. All these things are performed for him, our honored guest, the royal send-off here and gifts we give in love. Treat your guest and suppliant like a brother: anyone with a touch of sense knows that. So don't be crafty now, my friend, don't hide the truth I'm after. Fair is fair, speak out! Come, tell us the name they call you there at home — your mother, father, townsmen, neighbors round about. Surely no man in the world is nameless, all told. Born high, born low, as soon as he sees the light his parents always name him, once he's born. And tell me your land, your people, your city too, so our ships can sail you home — their wits will speed them there. For we have no steersmen here among Phaeacia's crews or steering-oars that guide your common craft. Our ships know in a flash their mates' intentions, know all ports of call and all the rich green fields. With wings of the wind they cross the sea's huge gulfs, shrouded in mist and cloud — no fear in the world of foundering, fatal shipwreck. True, there's an old tale 1 heard my father telling once. Nausithous used to say that lord Poseidon was vexed with us because we escorted all mankind and never came to grief. He said that one day, as a well-built ship of ours sailed home on the misty sea from such a convoy, the god would crush it, yes, and pile a huge mountain round about our port. So the old king foretold ... And as for the god, well, he can do his worst or leave it quite undone, whatever warms his heart. But come, my friend, tell us your own story now, and tell it truly. Where have your rovings forced you? What lands of men have you seen, what sturdy towns, what men themselves? Who were wild, savage, lawless? Who were friendly to strangers, god-fearing men? Tell me, why do you weep and grieve so sorely when you hear the fate of the Argives, hear the fall of Troy? That is the gods' work, spinning threads of death through the lives of mortal men, and all to make a song for those to come ... Did one of your kinsmen die before the walls of Troy, some brave man — a son by marriage? father by marriage? Next to our own blood kin, our nearest, dearest ties. Or a friend perhaps, someone close to your heart, staunch and loyal? No less dear than a brother, the brother-in-arms who shares our inmost thoughts." In the One-Eyed Giant's Cave Odysseus, the great teller of tales, launched out on his story: "Alcinous, majesty, shining among your island people, what a fine thing it is to listen to such a bard as we have here — ^the man sings like a god. The crown of life, I'd say. There's nothing better than when deep joy holds sway throughout the realm and banqueters up and down the palace sit in ranks, enthralled to hear the bard, and before them all, the tables heaped with bread and meats, and drawing wine from a mixing-bowl the steward makes his rounds and keeps the winecups flowing. This, to my mind, is the best that life can offer. But now you're set on probing the bitter pains I've borne, so I'm to weep and grieve, it seems, still more. Well then, what shall 1 go through first, what shall 1 save for last? What pains — the gods have given me my share. Now let me begin by telling you my name ... so you may know it well and 1 in times to come, if 1 can escape the fatal day, will be your host, your sworn friend, though my home is far from here. 1 am Odysseus, son of Laertes, known to the world for every kind of craft — my fame has reached the skies. Sunny Ithaca is my home. Atop her stands our seamark, Mount Neriton's leafy ridges shimmering in the wind. Around her a ring of islands circle side-by-side, Dulichion, Same, wooded Zacynthus too, but mine lies low and away, the farthest out to sea, rearing into the western dusk while the others face the east and breaking day. Mine is a rugged land but good for raising sons — and 1 myself, 1 know no sweeter sight on earth than a man's own native country. True enough. Calypso the lustrous goddess tried to hold me back, deep in her arching caverns, craving me for a husband. So did Circe, holding me just as warmly in her halls, the bewitching queen of Aeaea keen to have me too. But they never won the heart inside me, never. So nothing is as sweet as a man's own country, his own parents, even though he's settled down in some luxurious house, off in a foreign land and far from those who bore him. No more. Come, let me tell you about the voyage fraught with hardship Zeus inflicted on me, homeward bound from Troy ... The wind drove me out of Ilium on to Ismarus, the Cicones' stronghold. There 1 sacked the city, killed the men, but as for the wives and plunder, that rich haul we dragged away from the place — we shared it round so no one, not on my account, would go deprived of his fair share of spoils. Then I urged them to cut and run, set sail, but would they listen? Not those mutinous fools; there was too much wine to swill, too many sheep to slaughter down along the beach, and shambling longhorn cattle. And all the while the Cicones sought out other Cicones, called for help from their neighbors living inland: a larger force, and stronger soldiers too, skilled hands at fighting men from chariots, skilled, when a crisis broke, to fight on foot. Out of the morning mist they came against us — packed as the leaves and spears that flower forth in spring — and Zeus presented us with disaster, me and my comrades doomed to suffer blow on mortal blow. Lining up, both armies battled it out against our swift ships, both raked each other with hurtling bronze lances. Long as morning rose and the blessed day grew stronger we stood and fought them off, massed as they were, but then, when the sun wheeled past the hour for unyoking oxen, the Cicones broke our lines and beat us down at last. Out of each ship, six men-at-arms were killed; the rest of us rowed away from certain doom. From there we sailed on, glad to escape our death yet sick at heart for the dear companions we had lost. But 1 would not let our rolling ships set sail until the crews had raised the triple cry, saluting each poor comrade cut down by the fierce Cicones on that plain. Now Zeus who masses the stormclouds hit the fleet with the North Wind — a howling, demonic gale, shrouding over in thunderheads the earth and sea at once — and night swept down from the sky and the ships went plunging headlong on, our sails slashed to rags by the hurricane's blast! We struck them — cringing at death we rowed our ships to the nearest shoreline, pulled with all our power. There, for two nights, two days, we lay by, no letup, eating our hearts out, bent with pain and bone-tired. when Dawn with her lovely locks brought on the third day, then stepping the masts and hoisting white sails high, we lounged at the oarlocks, letting wind and helmsmen keep us true on course ... And now, at long last, 1 might have reached my native land unscathed, but just as 1 doubled Malea's cape, a tide-rip and the North Wind drove me way off course, careering past Cythera. Nine whole days 1 was borne along by rough, deadly winds on the fish-infested sea. Then on the tenth our squadron reached the land of the Lotus-eaters, people who eat the lotus, mellow fruit and flower. We disembarked on the coast, drew water there and crewmen snatched a meal by the swift ships. Once we'd had our fill of food and drink 1 sent a detail ahead, two picked men and a third, a runner, to scout out who might live there — men like us perhaps, who live on bread? So off they went and soon enough they mingled among the natives. Lotus-eaters, Lotus-eaters who had no notion of killing my companions, not at all, they simply gave them the lotus to taste instead ... Any crewmen who ate the lotus, the honey -sweet fruit, lost all desire to send a message back, much less return, their only wish to linger there with the Lotus-eaters, grazing on lotus, all memory of the journey home dissolved forever. But /brought them back, back to the hollow ships, and streaming tears — 1 forced them, hauled them under the rowing benches, lashed them fast and shouted out commands to my other, steady comrades: 'Quick, no time to lose, embark in the racing ships!' — so none could eat the lotus, forget the voyage home. They swung aboard at once, they sat to the oars in ranks and in rhythm churned the water white with stroke on stroke. From there we sailed on, our spirits now at a low ebb, and reached the land of the high and mighty Cyclops, lawless brutes, who trust so to the everlasting gods they never plant with their own hands or plow the soil. Unsown, unplowed, the earth teems with all they need, wheat, barley and vines, swelled by the rains of Zeus to yield a big full-bodied wine from clustered grapes. They have no meeting place for council, no laws either, no, up on the mountain peaks they live in arching caverns — each a law to himself, ruling his wives and children, not a care in the world for any neighbor. Now, a level island stretches flat across the harbor, not close inshore to the Cyclops' coast, not too far out, thick with woods where the wild goats breed by hundreds. No trampling of men to start them from their lairs, no hunters roughing it out on the woody ridges, stalking quarry, ever raid their haven. No flocks browse, no plowlands roll with wheat; unplowed, unsown forever — empty of humankind — the island just feeds droves of bleating goats. For the Cyclops have no ships with crimson prows, no shipwrights there to build them good trim craft that could sail them out to foreign ports of call as most men risk the seas to trade with other men. Such artisans would have made this island too a decent place to live in ... No mean spot, it could bear you any crop you like in season. The water-meadows along the low foaming shore run soft and moist, and your vines would never flag. The land's clear for plowing. Harvest on harvest, a man could reap a healthy stand of grain — the subsoil's dark and rich. There's a snug deep-water harbor there, what's more, no need for mooring-gear, no anchor-stones to heave, no cables to make fast. Just beach your keels, ride out the days till your shipmates' spirit stirs for open sea and a fair wind blows. And last, at the harbor's head there's a spring that rushes fresh from beneath a cave and black poplars flourish round its mouth. Well, here we landed, and surely a god steered us in through the pitch-black night. Not that he ever showed himself, with thick fog swirling around the ships, the moon wrapped in clouds and not a glimmer stealing through that gloom. Not one of us glimpsed the island — scanning hard — or the long combers rolling us slowly toward the coast, not till our ships had run their keels ashore. Beaching our vessels smoothly, striking sail, the crews swung out on the low shelving sand and there we fell asleep, awaiting Dawn's first light. When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more we all turned out, intrigued to tour the island. The local nymphs, the daughters of Zeus himself, flushed mountain-goats so the crews could make their meal. Quickly we fetched our curved bows and hunting spears from the ships and, splitting up into three bands, we started shooting, and soon enough some god had sent us bags of game to warm our hearts. A dozen vessels sailed in my command and to each crew nine goats were shared out and mine alone took ten. Then all day long till the sun went down we sat and feasted well on sides of meat and rounds of heady wine. The good red stock in our vessels' holds had not run out, there was still plenty left; the men had carried off a generous store in jars when we stormed and sacked the Cicones' holy city. Now we stared across at the Cyclops' shore, so near we could even see their smoke, hear their voices, their bleating sheep and goats ... And then when the sun had set and night came on we lay down and slept at the water's shelving edge. When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more 1 called a muster briskly, commanding all the hands. The rest of you stay here, my friends-in arms. I'll go across with my own ship and crew and probe the natives living over there. What are they — violent, savage, lawless? or friendly to strangers, god-fearing men?' With that 1 boarded ship and told the crew to embark at once and cast off cables quickly. They swung aboard, they sat to the oars in ranks and in rhythm churned the water white with stroke on stroke. But as soon as we reached the coast 1 mentioned — no long trip — we spied a cavern just at the shore, gaping above the surf, towering, overgrown with laurel. And here big flocks, sheep and goats, were stalled to spend the nights, and around its mouth a yard was walled up with quarried boulders sunk deep in the earth and enormous pines and oak-trees looming darkly ... Here was a giant's lair, in fact, who always pastured his sheepflocks far afield and never mixed with others. A grim loner, dead set in his own lawless ways. Here was a piece of work, by god, a monster built like no mortal who ever supped on bread, no, like a shaggy peak, I'd say — a man-mountain rearing head and shoulders over the world. Now then, 1 told most of my good trusty crew to wait, to sit tight by the ship and guard her well while 1 picked out my dozen finest fighters and off 1 went. But 1 took a skin of wine along, the ruddy, irresistible wine that Maron gave me once, Euanthes' son, a priest of Apollo, lord of Ismarus, because we'd rescued him, his wife and children, reverent as we were; he lived, you see, in Apollo's holy grove. And so in return he gave me splendid gifts, he handed me seven bars of well-wrought gold, a mixing-bowl of solid silver, then this wine ... He drew it off in generous wine-jars, twelve in all, all unmixed — and such a bouquet, a drink fit for the gods! No maid or man of his household knew that secret store, only himself, his loving wife and a single servant. Whenever they 'd drink the deep-red mellow vintage, twenty cups of water he'd stir in one of wine and what an aroma wafted from the bowl — what magic, what a godsend — no joy in holding back when tJlat^Nas poured! Filling a great goatskin now, 1 took this wine, provisions too in a leather sack. A sudden foreboding told my righting spirit I'd soon come up against some giant clad in power like armor-plate — a savage deaf to justice, blind to law. Our party quickly made its way to his cave but we failed to find our host himself inside; he was off in his pasture, ranging his sleek flocks. So we explored his den, gazing wide-eyed at it all, the large flat racks loaded with drying cheeses, the folds crowded with young lambs and kids, split into three groups — here the spring-born, here mid-yearlings, here the fresh sucklings off to the side — each sort was penned apart. And all his vessels, pails and hammered buckets he used for milking, were brimming full with whey. From the start my comrades pressed me, pleading hard, 'Let's make away with the cheeses, then come back — hurry, drive the lambs and kids from the pens to our swift ship, put out to sea at once!' But 1 would not give way — and how much better it would have been — not till 1 saw him, saw what gifts he'd give. But he proved no lovely sight to my companions. There we built a fire, set our hands on the cheeses, offered some to the gods and ate the bulk ourselves and settled down inside, awaiting his return ... And back he came from pasture, late in the day, herding his flocks home, and lugging a huge load of good dry logs to fuel his fire at supper. He flung them down in the cave — a jolting crash — we scuttled in panic into the deepest dark recess. And next he drove his sleek flocks into the open vault, all he'd milk at least, but he left the males outside, rams and billy goats out in the high- walled yard. Then to close his door he hoisted overhead a tremendous, massive slab — no twenty -two wagons, rugged and four-wheeled, could budge that boulder off the ground, 1 tell you, such an immense stone the monster wedged to block his cave! Then down he squatted to milk his sheep and bleating goats, each in order, and put a suckUng underneath each dam. And half of the fresh white milk he curdled quickly, set it aside in wicker racks to press for cheese, the other half let stand in pails and buckets, ready at hand to wash his supper down. As soon as he'd briskly finished all his chores he lit his fire and spied us in the blaze and 'Strangers! 'he thundered out, 'now who are you? Where did you sail from, over the running sea-lanes? Out on a trading spree or roving the waves like pirates, sea-wolves raiding at will, who risk their lives to plunder other men?' The hearts inside us shook, terrified by his rumbling voice and monstrous hulk. Nevertheless 1 found the nerve to answer, firmly, 'Men of Achaea we are and bound now from Troy! Driven far off course by the warring winds, over the vast gulf of the sea — battling home on a strange tack, a route that's off the map, and so we've come to you ... so it must please King Zeus's plotting heart. We're glad to say we're men of Atrides Agamemnon, whose fame is the proudest thing on earth these days, so great a city he sacked, such multitudes he killed! But since we've chanced on you, we're at your knees in hopes of a warm welcome, even a guest-gift. the sort that hosts give strangers. That's the custom. Respect the gods, my friend. We're suppliants — at your mercy! Zeus of the Strangers guards all guests and suppliants: strangers are sacred — Zeus will avenge their rights!' 'Stranger/ he grumbled back from his brutal heart, 'you must be a fool, stranger, or come from nowhere, telling me to fear the gods or avoid their wrath! We Cyclops never blink at Zeus and Zeus's shield of storm and thunder, or any other blessed god — we've got more force by far. I'd never spare you in fear of Zeus's hatred, you or your comrades here, unless 1 had the urge. But tell me, where did you moor your sturdy ship when you arrived? Up the coast or close in? I'd just like to know.' So he laid his trap but he never caught me, no, wise to the world 1 shot back in my crafty way, 'My ship? Poseidon god of the earthquake smashed my ship, he drove it against the rocks at your island's far cape, dashed it against a cliff as the winds rode us in. 1 and the men you see escaped a sudden death.' Not a word in reply to that, the ruthless brute. Lurching up, he lunged out with his hands toward my men and snatching two at once, rapping them on the ground he knocked them dead like pups — their brains gushed out all over, soaked the floor — and ripping them limb from limb to fbc his meal he bolted them down like a mountain-lion, left no scrap, devoured entrails, flesh and bones, marrow and all! We flung our arms to Zeus, we wept and cried aloud, looking on at his grisly work — paralyzed, appalled. But once the Cyclops had stuffed his enormous gut with human flesh, washing it down with raw milk, he slept in his cave, stretched out along his flocks. And 1 with my fighting heart, 1 thought at first to steal up to him, draw the sharp sword at my hip and stab his chest where the midriff packs the liver — 1 groped for the fatal spot but a fresh thought held me back. There at a stroke we'd finish off ourselves as well — how could tvewith our bare hands heave back that slab he set to block his cavern's gaping maw? So we lay there groaning, waiting Dawn's first light. When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more the monster relit his fire and milked his handsome ewes, each in order, putting a suckling underneath each dam, and as soon as he'd briskly finished all his chores he snatched up two more men and fixed his meal. Well-fed, he drove his fat sheep from the cave, lightly lifting the huge doorslab up and away, then slipped it back in place as a hunter flips the lid of his quiver shut. Piercing whistles — turning his flocks to the hills he left me there, the heart inside me brooding on revenge: how could 1 pay him back? would Athena give me glory? Here was the plan that struck my mind as best ... the Cyclops' great club: there it lay by the pens, olivewood, full of sap. He'd lopped it off to brandish once it dried. Looking it over, we judged it big enough to be the mast of a pitch-black ship with her twenty oars, a freighter broad in the beam that plows through miles of sea — so long, so thick it bulked before our eyes. Well, flanking it now, 1 chopped off a fathom's length, pushed it to comrades, told them to plane it down, and they made the club smooth as 1 bent and shaved the tip to a stabbing point. 1 turned it over the blazing fire to char it good and hard, then hid it well, buried deep under the dung that littered the cavern's floor in thick wet clumps. And now 1 ordered my shipmates all to cast lots — who'd brave it out with me to hoist our stake and grind it into his eye when sleep had overcome him? Luck of the draw: I got the very ones I would have picked myself, four good men, and 1 in the lead made five ... Nightfall brought him back, herding his woolly sheep and he quickly drove the sleek flock into the vaulted cavern, rams and all — none left outside in the walled yard — his own idea, perhaps, or a god led him on. Then he hoisted the huge slab to block the door and squatted to milk his sheep and bleating goats, each in order, putting a suckling underneath each dam, and as soon as he'd briskly finished all his chores he snatched up two more men and fixed his meal. But this time 1 lifted a carved wooden bowl, brimful of my ruddy wine, and went right up to the Cyclops, enticing, 'Here, Cyclops, try this wine — to top off the banquet of human flesh you've bolted down! Judge for yourself what stock our ship had stored. 1 brought it here to make you a fine libation, hoping you would pity me, Cyclops, send me home, but your rages are insufferable. You barbarian — how can any man on earth come visit you after this? What you've done outrages all that's right!' At that he seized the bowl and tossed it off and the heady wine pleased him immensely. 'More' — he demanded a second bowl — 'a hearty helping! And tell me your name now, quickly, so 1 can hand my guest a gift to warm Azs heart. Our soil yields the Cyclops powerful, full-bodied wine and the rains from Zeus build its strength. But this, this is nectar, ambrosia — this flows from heaven!' So he declared. 1 poured him another fiery bowl — three bowls 1 brimmed and three he drank to the last drop, the fool, and then, when the wine was swirling round his brain, 1 approached my host with a cordial, winning word: 'So, you ask me the name I'm known by, Cyclops? I will tell you. But you must give me a guest-gift as you've promised. Nobody — that's my name. Nobody — so my mother and father call me, all my friends.' But he boomed back at me from his ruthless heart, 'Nobody?\'\\ eat Nobody last of all his friends — I'll eat the others first! That's my gift to you!' With that he toppled over, sprawled full-length, flat on his back and lay there, his massive neck slumping to one side, and sleep that conquers all overwhelmed him now as wine came spurting, flooding up from his gullet with chunks of human flesh — he vomited, blind drunk. Now, at last, 1 thrust our stake in a bed of embers to get it red-hot and rallied all my comrades: Courage — no panic, no one hang back now!' And green as it was, just as the olive stake was about to catch fire — the glow terrific, yes — 1 dragged it from the flames, my men clustering round as some god breathed enormous courage through us all. Hoisting high that olive stake with its stabbing point, straight into the monster's eye they rammed it hard — 1 drove my weight on it from above and bored it home as a shipwright bores his beam with a shipwright's drill that men below, whipping the strap back and forth, whirl and the drill keeps twisting faster, never stopping — So we seized our stake with its fiery tip and bored it round and round in the giant's eye till blood came boiling up around that smoking shaft and the hot blast singed his brow and eyelids round the core and the broiling eyeball burst — its crackling roots blazed and hissed — as a blacksmith plunges a glowing ax or adze in an ice-cold bath and the metal screeches steam and its temper hardens — that's the iron's strength — so the eye of the Cyclops sizzled round that stake! He loosed a hideous roar, the rock walls echoed round and we scuttled back in terror. The monster wrenched the spike from his eye and out it came with a red geyser of blood — he flung it aside with frantic hands, and mad with pain he bellowed out for help from his neighbor Cyclops living round about in caves on windswept crags. Hearing his cries, they lumbered up from every side and hulking round his cavern, asked what ailed him: 'What, Polyphemus, what in the world's the trouble? Roaring out in the godsent night to rob us of our sleep. Surely no one's rustling your flocks against your will — surely no one's trying to kill you now by fraud or force!' 'Nobody, friends' — Polyphemus bellowed back from his cave — Nobody's killing me now by fraud and not by force." 7/you're alone,' his friends boomed back at once, 'and nobody's trying to overpower you now — look, it must be a plague sent here by mighty Zeus and there's no escape from that You'd better pray to your father, Lord Poseidon.' They lumbered off, but laughter filled my heart to think how nobody's name — my great cunning stroke — had duped them one and all. But the Cyclops there, still groaning, racked with agony, groped around for the huge slab, and heaving it from the doorway, down he sat in the cave's mouth, his arms spread wide, hoping to catch a comrade stealing out with sheep — such a blithering fool he took me for! But 1 was already plotting ... what was the best way out? how could 1 find escape from death for my crew, myself as well? My wits kept weaving, weaving cunning schemes — life at stake, monstrous death staring us in the face — till this plan struck my mind as best. That flock, those well-fed rams with their splendid thick fleece, sturdy, handsome beasts sporting their dark weight of wool: I lashed them abreast, quietly, twisting the willow-twigs the Cyclops slept on — giant, lawless brute — I took them three by three; each ram in the middle bore a man while the two rams either side would shield him well. So three beasts to bear each man, but as for myself? There was one bellwether ram, the prize of all the flock, and clutching him by his back, tucked up under his shaggy belly, there 1 hung, face upward, both hands locked in his marvelous deep fleece, clinging for dear life, my spirit steeled, enduring ... So we held on, desperate, waiting Dawn's first light. As soon as young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more the rams went rumbling out of the cave toward pasture, the ewes kept bleating round the pens, unmilked, their udders about to burst. Their master now, heaving in torment, felt the back of each animal halting before him here, but the idiot never sensed my men were trussed up under their thick fleecy ribs. And last of them all came my great ram now, striding out, weighed down with his dense wool and my deep plots. Stroking him gently, powerful Polyphemus murmured, 'Dear old ram, why last of the flock to quit the cave? In the good old days you'd never lag behind the rest — you with your long marching strides, first by far of the flock to graze the fresh young grasses, first by far to reach the rippling streams, first to turn back home, keen for your fold when night comes on — but now you're last of all. And why? Sick at heart for your master's eye that coward gouged out with his wicked crew? — only after he'd stunned my wits with wine — that, that Nobody ... who's not escaped his death, 1 swear, not yet. Oh if only you thought like me, had words like me to tell me where that scoundrel is cringing from my rage! I'd smash him against the ground, I'd spill his brains — flooding across my cave — and that would ease my heart of the pains that good-for-nothing Nobody made me suffer!' And with that threat he let my ram go free outside. But soon as we'd got one foot past cave and courtyard, first 1 loosed myself from the ram, then loosed my men, then quickly, glancing back again and again we drove our flock, good plump beasts with their long sharks, straight to the ship, and a welcome sight we were to loyal comrades — we who'd escaped our deaths — but for all the rest they broke down and wailed. 1 cut it short, 1 stopped each shipmate's cries, my head tossing, brows frowning, silent signals to hurry, tumble our fleecy herd on board, launch out on the open sea! They swung aboard, they sat to the oars in rank; and in rhythm churned the water white with stroke on stroke. But once offshore as far as a man's shout can carry, 1 called back to the Cyclops, stinging taunts: 'So, Cyclops, no weak coward it was whose crew you bent to devour there in your vaulted cave — . you with your brute force! Your filthy crimes came down on your own head, you shameless cannibal, daring to eat your guests in your own house — so Zeus and the other gods have paid you back!' That made the rage of the monster boil over. Ripping off the peak of a towering crag, he heaved it so hard the boulder landed just in front of our dark prow and a huge swell reared up as the rock went plunging under — a tidal wave from the open sea. The sudden backwash drove us landward again, forcing us close inshore but grabbing a long pole, 1 thrust us off and away, tossing my head for dear life, signaling crews to put their backs in the oars, escape grim death. They threw themselves in the labor, rowed on fast but once we'd plowed the breakers twice as far, again 1 began to taunt the Cyclops — men around me trying to check me, calm me, left and right: 'So headstrong — why? Why rile the beast again?' 'That rock he flung in the sea just now, hurling our ship to shore once more — we thought we'd die on the spot!' 'If he'd caught a sound from oneoi us, just a whisper, he would have crushed our heads and ship timbers with one heave of another flashing, jagged rock!' 'Good god, the brute can throw!' So they begged but they could not bring my fighting spirit round. 1 called back with another burst of anger, 'Cyclops — if any man on the face of the earth should ask you who blinded you, shamed you so — say Odysseus, raider of cities, gouged out your eye, Laertes' son who makes his home in Ithaca!' So 1 vaunted and he groaned back in answer, 'Oh no, no — ^that prophecy years ago ... it all comes home to me with a vengeance now! We once had a prophet here, a great tall man, Telemus, Eurymus' son, a master at reading signs, who grew old in his trade among his fellow-Cyclops. All this, he warned me, would come to pass someday — that I'd be blinded here at the hands of one Odysseus. But 1 always looked for a handsome giant man to cross my path, some fighter clad in power like armor-plate, but now, look what a dwarf, a spineless good-for-nothing, stuns me with wine, then gouges out my eye! Come here, Odysseus, let me give you a guest-gift and urge Poseidon the earthquake god to speed you home. 1 am his son and he claims to be my father, true, and he himself will heal me if he pleases — no other blessed god, no man can do the work!' '7/ea7you!'— here was my parting shot — Would to god I could strip you of life and breath and ship you down to the House of Death as surely as no one will ever heal your eye, not even your earthquake god himself!' But at that he bellowed out to lord Poseidon, thrusting his arms to the starry skies, and prayed, 'Hear me — Poseidon, god of the sea-blue mane who rocks the earth! If 1 really am your son and you claim to be my father — come, grant that Odysseus, raider of cities, Laertes' son who makes his home in Ithaca, never reaches home. Or if he's fated to see his people once again and reach his well-built house and his own native country, let him come home late and come a broken man — all shipmates lost, alone in a stranger's ship — and let him find a world of pain at home!' So he prayed and the god of the sea-blue mane Poseidon heard his prayer. The monster suddenly hoisted a boulder — far larger — wheeled and heaved it, putting his weight behind it, massive strength, and the boulder crashed close, landing just in the wake of our dark stern, just failing to graze the rudder's bladed edge. A huge swell reared up as the rock went plunging under, yes, and the tidal breaker drove us out to our island's far shore where all my well-decked ships lay moored, clustered, waiting, and huddled round them, crewmen sat in anguish, waiting, chafing for our return. We beached our vessel hard ashore on the sand, we swung out in the frothing surf ourselves, and herding Cyclops' sheep from our deep holds we shared them round so no one, not on my account, would go deprived of his fair share of spoils. But the splendid ram — as we meted out the flocks my f riends-in-arms made him my prize of honor, mine alone, and 1 slaughtered him on the beach and burnt his thighs to Cronus' mighty son. Zeus of the thundercloud who rules the world. But my sacrifices failed to move the god: Zeus was still obsessed with plans to destroy my entire oarswept fleet and loyal crew of comrades. Now all day long till the sun went down we sat and feasted on sides of meat and heady wine. Then when the sun had set and night came on we lay down and slept at the water's shelving edge. When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more 1 roused the men straightway, ordering all crews to man the ships and cast off cables quickly. They swung aboard at once, they sat to the oars in ranks and in rhythm churned the water white with stroke on stroke. And from there we sailed on, glad to escape our death yet sick at heart for the comrades we had lost." BookX The Bewitching Queen of Aeaea "We reached the Aeolian island next, the home of Aeolus, Hippotas' son, beloved by the gods who never die — a great floating island it was, and round it all huge ramparts rise of indestructible bronze and sheer rock cliffs shoot up from sea to sky. The king had sired twelve children within his halls, six daughters and six sons in the lusty prime of youth, so he gave his daughters as wives to his six sons. Seated beside their dear father and doting mother, with delicacies aplenty spread before them, they feast on forever ... All day long the halls breathe the savor of roasted meats and echo round to the low moan of blowing pipes, and all night long, each one by his faithful mate, they sleep under soft-piled rugs on corded bedsteads. To this city of theirs we came, their splendid palace, and Aeolus hosted me one entire month, he pressed me for news of Troy and the Argive ships and how we sailed for home, and 1 told him the whole long story, first to last. And then, when 1 begged him to send me on my way, he denied me nothing, he went about my passage. He gave me a sack, the skin of a full-grown ox, binding inside the winds that howl from every quarter, for Zeus had made that king the master of all the winds, with power to calm them down or rouse them as he pleased. Aeolus stowed the sack inside my holds, lashed so fast with a burnished silver cord not even a slight puff could slip past that knot. Yet he set the West Wind free to blow us on our way and waft our squadron home. But his plan was bound to fail, yes, our own reckless folly swept us on to ruin ... Nine whole days we sailed, nine nights, nonstop. On the tenth our own land hove into sight at last — we were so close we could see men tending fires. But now an enticing sleep came on me, bone-weary from working the vessel's sheet myself, no letup, never trusting the ropes to any other mate, the faster to journey back to native land. But the crews began to mutter among themselves, sure 1 was hauling troves of gold and silver home, the gifts of open-hearted Aeolus, Hippotas' son. 'The old story!' One man glanced at another, grumbling. 'Look at our captain's luck — so loved by the world, so prized at every landfall, every port of call.' 'Heaps of lovely plunder he hauls home from Troy, while we who went through slogging just as hard, we go home empty-handed.' 'Now this Aeolus loads him down with treasure. Favoritism, friend to friend!' 'Hurry, let's see what loot is in that sack, how much gold and silver. Break it open — now!' A fatal plan, but it won my shipmates over. They loosed the sack and all the winds burst out and a sudden squall struck and swept us back to sea, wailing, in tears, far from our own native land. And 1 woke up with a start, my spirit churning — should 1 leap over the side and drown at once or grin and bear it, stay among the living? 1 bore it all, held firm, hiding my face, clinging tight to the decks while heavy squalls blasted our squadron back again to Aeolus' island, shipmates groaning hard. We disembarked on the coast, drew water there and crewmen snatched a meal by the swift ships. Once we'd had our fill of food and drink 1 took a shipmate along with me, a herald too, and approached King Aeolus' famous halls and here we found him feasting beside his wife and many children. Reaching the doorposts at the threshold, down we sat but our hosts, amazed to see us, only shouted questions: 'Back again, Odysseus — ^why? Some blustering god attacked you? Surely we launched you well, we sped you on your way to your own land and house, or any place you pleased.' So they taunted, and 1 replied in deep despair, 'A mutinous crew undid me — that and a cruel sleep. Set it to rights, my friends. You have the power!' So 1 pleaded — gentle, humble appeals — but our hosts turned silent, hushed ... and the father broke forth with an ultimatum: 'Away from my island — fast — most cursed man alive! It's a crime to host a man or speed him on his way when the blessed deathless gods despise him so. Crawling back like this— it proves the immortals hate you! Out — get out!' Groan as I did, his curses drove me from his halls and from there we pulled away with heavy hearts, with the crews' spirit broken under the oars' labor, thanks to our own folly ... no favoring wind in sight. Six whole days we rowed, six nights, nonstop. On the seventh day we raised the Laestrygonian land, Telepylus heights where the craggy fort of Lamus rises. Where shepherd calls to shepherd as one drives in his flocks and the other drives his out and he calls back in answer, where a man who never sleeps could rake in double wages, one for herding cattle, one for pasturing fleecy sheep, the nightfall and the sunrise march so close together. We entered a fine harbor there, all walled around by a great unbroken sweep of sky -scraping cliff and two steep headlands, fronting each other, close around the mouth so the passage in is cramped. Here the rest of my rolling squadron steered, right into the gaping cove and moored tightly, prow by prow. Never a swell there, big or small; a milk-white calm spreads all around the place. But 1 alone anchored my black ship outside, well clear of the harbor's jaws 1 tied her fast to a cliff side with a cable. 1 scaled its rock face to a lookout on its crest but glimpsed no trace of the work of man or beast from there; all 1 spied was a plume of smoke, drifting off the land. So 1 sent some crew ahead to learn who lived there — men like us perhaps, who live f?/? bread? Two good mates 1 chose and a third to run the news. They disembarked and set out on a beaten trail the wagons used for hauling timber down to town from the mountain heights above ... and before the walls they met a girl, drawing water, Antiphates' strapping daughter — king of the Laestrygonians. She'd come down to a clear running spring, Artacia, where the local people came to fill their pails. My shipmates clustered round her, asking questions: who was king of the realm? who ruled the natives here? She waved at once to her father's high-roofed halls. They entered the sumptuous palace, found his wife inside — a woman huge as a mountain crag who filled them all with horror. Straightaway she summoned royal Antiphates from assembly, her husband, who prepared my crew a barbarous welcome. Snatching one of my men, he tore him up for dinner — the other two sprang free and reached the ships. But the king let loose a howling through the town that brought tremendous Laestrygonians swarming up from every side — hundreds, not like men, like Giants' Down from the cliffs they flung great rocks a man could hardly hoist and a ghastly shattering din rose up from all the ships — men in their death-cries, hulls smashed to splinters — They speared the crews like fish and whisked them home to make their grisly meal. But while they killed them off in the harbor depths 1 pulled the sword from beside my hip and hacked away at the ropes that moored my blue-prowed ship of war and shouted rapid orders at my shipmates: 'Put your backs in the oars — now row or die!' In terror of death they ripped the swells — all as one — and what a joy as we darted out toward open sea, clear of those beetling cliffs ... my ship alone. But the rest went down en masse. Our squadron sank. From there we sailed on, glad to escape our death yet sick at heart for the dear companions we had lost. We reached the Aeaean island next, the home of Circe the nymph with lovely braids, an awesome power too who can speak with human voice, the true sister of murderous-minded Aeetes. Both were bred by the Sun who lights our lives; their mother was Perse, a child the Ocean bore. We brought our ship to port without a sound as a god eased her into a harbor safe and snug, and for two days and two nights we lay by there, eating our hearts out, bent with pain and bone-tired. When Dawn with her lovely locks brought on the third day, at last 1 took my spear and my sharp sword again, rushed up from the ship to find a lookout point, hoping to glimpse some sign of human labor, catch some human voices ... 1 scaled a commanding crag and, scanning hard, 1 could just make out some smoke from Circe's halls, drifting up from the broad terrain through brush and woods. Mulling it over, 1 thought I'd scout the ground — that fire aglow in the smoke, 1 saw it, true, but soon enough this seemed the better plan: I'd go back to shore and the swift ship first, feed the men, then send them out for scouting. 1 was well on my way down, nearing our ship when a god took pity on me, wandering all alone; he sent me a big stag with high branching antlers, right across my path — the sun's heat forced him down from his forest range to drink at a river's banks — just bounding out of the timber when 1 hit him square in the backbone, halfway down the spine and my bronze spear went punching clean through — he dropped in the dust, groaning, gasping out his breath. Treading on him, 1 wrenched my bronze spear from the wound, left it there on the ground, and snapping off some twigs and creepers, twisted a rope about a fathom long, 1 braided it tight, hand over hand, then lashed the four hocks of that magnificent beast. Loaded round my neck 1 lugged him toward the ship, trudging, propped on my spear — no way to sling him over a shoulder, steadying him with one free arm — the kill was so immense! 1 flung him down by the hull and roused the men, going up to them all with a word to lift their spirits: 'Listen to me, my comrades, brothers in hardship — we won't go down to the House of Death, not yet. not till our day arrives. Up with you, look, there's still some meat and drink in our good ship. Put our minds on food — why die of hunger here?' My hardy urging brought them round at once. Heads came up from cloaks and there by the barren sea they gazed at the stag, their eyes wide — my noble trophy. But once they'd looked their fill and warmed their hearts, they washed their hands and prepared a splendid meal. Now all day long till the sun went down we sat and feasted on sides of meat and seasoned wine. Then when the sun had set and night came on we lay down and slept at the water 's shelving edge. When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more 1 called a muster quickly, informing all the crew, 'Listen to me, my comrades, brothers in hardship, we can't tell east from west, the dawn from the dusk, nor where the sun that lights our lives goes under earth nor where it rises. We must think of a plan at once, some cunning stroke. 1 doubt there's one still left. 1 scaled a commanding crag and from that height surveyed an entire island ringed like a crown by endless wastes of sea. But the land itself lies low, and 1 did see smoke drifting up from its heart through thick brush and woods. ' My message broke their spirit as they recalled the gruesome work of the Laestrygonian king Antiphates and the hearty cannibal Cyclops thirsting for our blood. They burst into cries, wailing, streaming live tears that gained us nothing — what good can come of grief? And so, numbering off my band of men-at-arms into two platoons, 1 assigned them each a leader: 1 took one and lord Eurylochus the other. We quickly shook lots in a bronze helmet — the lot of brave Eurylochus leapt out first. So he moved off with his two and twenty comrades. weeping, leaving us behind in tears as well ... Deep in the wooded glens they came on Circe's palace built of dressed stone on a cleared rise of land. Mountain wolves and lions were roaming round the grounds — she'd bewitched them herself, she gave them magic drugs. But they wouldn't attack my men; they just came pawing up around them, fawning, swishing their long tails — eager as hounds that fawn around their master, coming home from a feast, who always brings back scraps to calm them down. So they came nuzzling round my men — lions, wolves with big powerful claws — and the men cringed in fear at sight of those strange, ferocious beasts ... But still they paused at her doors, the nymph with lovely braids, Circe — and deep inside they heard her singing, lifting her spellbinding voice as she glided back and forth at her great immortal loom, her enchanting web a shimmering glory only goddesses can weave. Polites, captain of armies, took command, the closest, most devoted man 1 had: 'Friends, there's someone inside, plying a great loom, and how she sings — enthralling! The whole house is echoing to her song. Goddess or woman — let's call out to her now!' So he urged and the men called out and hailed her. She opened her gleaming doors at once and stepped forth, inviting them all in, and in they went, all innocence. Only Eurylochus stayed behind — he sensed a trap ... She ushered them in to sit on high-backed chairs, then she mixed them a potion — cheese, barley and pale honey mulled in Pramnian wine — but into the brew she stirred her wicked drugs to wipe from their memories any thought of home. Once they'd drained the bowls she filled, suddenly she struck with her wand, drove them into her pigsties, all of them bristling into swine — ^with grunts, snouts — even their bodies, yes, and only the men's minds stayed steadfast as before. So off they went to their pens, sobbing, squealing as Circe flung them acorns, cornel nuts and mast, common fodder for hogs that root and roll in mud. Back Eurylochus ran to our swift black ship to tell the disaster our poor friends had faced. But try as he might, he couldn't get a word out. Numbing sorrow had stunned the man to silence — tears welled in his eyes, his heart possessed by grief. We assailed him with questions — all at our wits' end — till at last he could recount the fate our friends had met: 'Off we went through the brush, captain, as you commanded. Deep in the wooded glens we came on Circe's palace built of dressed stone on a cleared rise of land. Someone inside was plying a great loom, and how she sang — in a high clear voice! Goddess or woman — we called out and hailed her ... She opened her gleaming doors at once and stepped forth, inviting us all in, and in we went, all innocence. But /stayed behind — 1 sensed a trap. Suddenly all vanished — blotted out — not one face showed again, though 1 sat there keeping watch a good long time.' At that report 1 slung the hefty bronze blade of my silver-studded sword around my shoulder, slung my bow on too and told our comrade, 'Lead me back by the same way that you came. ' But he flung both arms around my knees and pleaded, begging me with his tears and winging words: 'Don't force me back there, captain, king — leave me here on the spot. You will never return yourself, 1 swear, you'll never bring back a single man alive. Quick, cut and run with the rest of us here — we can still escape the fatal day!' But I shot back, Eurylochus, stay right here, eating, drinking, safe by the black ship. I must be off. Necessity drives me on.' Leaving the ship and shore, I headed inland, clambering up through hushed, entrancing glades until, as 1 was nearing the halls of Circe skilled in spells, approaching her palace — Hermes god of the golden wand crossed my path, and he looked for all the world like a young man sporting his first beard, just in the prime and warm pride of youth, and grasped me by the hand and asked me kindly, 'Where are you going now, my unlucky friend — trekking over the hills alone in unfamiliar country? And your men are all in there, in Circe's palace, cooped like swine, hock by jowl in the sties. Have you come to set them free? Well, 1 warn you, you won't get home yourself, you'll stay right there, trapped with all the rest. But wait, 1 can save you, free you from that great danger. Look, here is a potent drug. Take it to Circe's halls — its power alone will shield you from the fatal day. Let me tell you of all the witch's subtle craft ... She'll mix you a potion, lace the brew with drugs but she'll be powerless to bewitch you, even so — this magic herb 1 give will fight her spells. Now here's your plan of action, step by step. The moment Circe strikes with her long thin wand, you draw your sharp sword sheathed at your hip and rush her fast as if to run her through! She'll cower in fear and coax you to her bed — but don't refuse the goddess' bed, not then, not if she's to release your friends and treat you well yourself. But have her swear the binding oath of the blessed gods she'll never plot some new intrigue to harm you, once you lie there naked — never unman you, strip away your courage!' With that the giant-killer handed over the magic herb. pulling it from the earth, and Hermes showed me all its name and nature. Its root is black and its flower white as milk and the gods call it moly. Dangerous for a mortal man to pluck from the soil but not for deathless gods. All lies within their power. Now Hermes went his way to the steep heights of Olympus, over the island's woods while 1, just approaching the halls of Circe, my heart a heaving storm at every step, paused at her doors, the nymph with lovely braids — 1 stood and shouted to her there. She heard my voice, she opened the gleaming doors at once and stepped forth, inviting me in, and in 1 went, all anguish now ... She led me in to sit on a silver-studded chair, ornately carved, with a stool to rest my feet. In a golden bowl she mixed a potion for me to drink, stirring her poison in, her heart aswirl with evil. And then she passed it on, 1 drank it down but it never worked its spell — she struck with her wand and 'Now,' she cried, 'off to your sty, you swine, and wallow with your friends!' But 1, 1 drew my sharp sword sheathed at my hip and rushed her fast as if to run her through — She screamed, slid under my blade, hugged my knees with a flood of warm tears and a burst of winging words: 'Who are you? where are you from? your city? your parents? I'm wonderstruck — you drank my drugs, you're not bewitched! Never has any other man withstood my potion, never, once it's past his lips and he has drunk it down. You have a mind in you no magic can enchant! You must be Odysseus, man of twists and turns — Hermes the giant-killer, god of the golden wand, he always said you'd come, homeward bound from Troy in your swift black ship. Come, sheathe your sword, let's go to bed together, mount my bed and mix in the magic work of love — we'll breed deep trust between us. ' So she enticed but I fought back, still wary. 'Circe, Circe, how dare you tell me to treat you with any warmth? You who turned my men to swine in your own house and now you hold me here as well — teeming with treachery you lure me to your room to mount your bed, so once 1 lie there naked you'll unman me, strip away my courage! Mount your bed? Not for all the world. Not until you consent to swear, goddess, a binding oath you'll never plot some new intrigue to harm me!' Straightaway she began to swear the oath that 1 required — never, she'd never do me harm — and when she'd finished, then, at last, 1 mounted Circe's gorgeous bed ... At the same time her handmaids bustled through the halls, four in all who perform the goddess' household tasks: nymphs, daughters born of the springs and groves and the sacred rivers running down to open sea. One draped the chairs with fine crimson covers over the seats she'd spread with linen cloths below. A second drew up silver tables before the chairs and laid out golden trays to hold the bread. A third mulled heady, heart- warming wine in a silver bowl and set out golden cups. A fourth brought water and lit a blazing fire beneath a massive cauldron. The water heated soon, and once it reached the boil in the glowing bronze she eased me into a tub and bathed me from the cauldron, mixing the hot and cold to suit my taste, showering head and shoulders down until she'd washed away the spirit-numbing exhaustion from my body. The bathing finished, rubbing me sleek with oil, throwing warm fleece and a shirt around my shoulders, she led me in to sit on a silver-studded chair, ornately carved, with a stool to rest my feet. A maid brought water soon in a graceful golden pitcher and over a silver basin tipped it out so I might rinse my hands, then pulled a gleaming table to my side. A staid housekeeper brought on bread to serve me, appetizers aplenty too, lavish with her bounty. She pressed me to eat. 1 had no taste for food. 1 just sat there, mind wandering, far away ... lost in grim forebodings. As soon as Circe saw me, huddled, not touching my food, immersed in sorrow, she sidled near with a coaxing, winged word: 'Odysseus, why just sit there, struck dumb, eating your heart out, not touching food or drink? Suspect me of still more treachery? Nothing to fear. Haven't 1 just sworn my solemn, binding oath?' So she asked, but 1 protested, Circe — how could any man in his right mind endure the taste of food and drink before he'd freed his comrades-in-arms and looked them in the eyes? If you, you really want me to eat and drink, set them free, all my beloved comrades — let me feast my eyes.' So 1 demanded. Circe strode on through the halls and out, her wand held high in hand and, flinging open the pens, drove forth my men, who looked like full-grown swine. Facing her, there they stood as she went along the ranks, anointing them one by one with some new magic oil — and look, the bristles grown by the first wicked drug that Circe gave them slipped away from their limbs and they turned men again: younger than ever, taller by far, more handsome to the eye, and yes, they knew me at once and each man grasped my hands and a painful longing for tears overcame us all, a terrible sobbing echoed through the house ... The goddess herself was moved and, standing by me, warmly urged me on — a lustrous goddess now: 'Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, tried and true, go at once to your ship at the water's edge, haul her straight up on the shore first and stow your cargo and running gear in caves, then back you come and bring your trusty crew.' Her urging won my stubborn spirit over. Down 1 went to the swift ship at the water's edge, and there on the decks 1 found my loyal crew consumed with grief and weeping live warm tears. But now, as calves in stalls when cows come home, droves of them herded back from field to farmyard once they've grazed their fill — as all their young calves come frisking out to meet them, bucking out of their pens, lowing nonstop, jostling, rushing round their mothers — so my shipmates there at the sight of my return came pressing round me now, streaming tears, so deeply moved in their hearts they felt as if they'd made it back to their own land, their city, Ithaca's rocky soil where they were bred and reared. And through their tears their words went winging home: 'You're back again, my king! How thrilled we are — as if we'd reached our country, Ithaca, at last! But come, tell us about the fate our comrades met.' Still I replied with a timely word of comfort: 'Let's haul our ship straight up on the shore first and stow our cargo and running gear in caves. Then hurry, all of you, come along with me to see our friends in the magic halls of Circe, eating and drinking — ^the feast flows on forever.' So I said and they jumped to do my bidding. Only Eurylochus tried to hold my shipmates back, his mutinous outburst aimed at one and all: 'Poor fools, where are we running now? Why are we tempting fate? — why stumble blindly down to Circe's halls? She'll turn us all into pigs or wolves or lions made to guard that palace of hers — by force, 1 tell you — just as the Cyclops trapped our comrades in his lair with hotheaded Odysseus right beside them all — thanks to this man's rashness t/iey died too!' So he declared and 1 had half a mind to draw the sharp sword from beside my hip and slice his head off, tumbling down in the dust, close kin that he was. But comrades checked me, each man trying to calm me, left and right: 'Captain, we'll leave him here if you command, just where he is, to sit and guard the ship. Lead us on to the magic halls of Circe.' With that, up from the ship and shore they headed inland. Nor did Eurylochus malinger by the hull; he straggled behind the rest, dreading the sharp blast of my rebuke. All the while Circe had bathed my other comrades in her palace, caring and kindly, rubbed them sleek with oil and decked them out in fleecy cloaks and shirts. We found them all together, feasting in her halls. Once we had recognized each other, gazing face-to-face, we all broke down and wept — and the house resounded now and Circe the lustrous one came toward me, pleading, 'Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, man of action, no more tears now, calm these tides of sorrow. Well 1 know what pains you bore on the swarming sea, what punishment you endured from hostile men on land. But come now, eat your food and drink your wine till the same courage fills your chests, now as then, when you first set sail from native land, from rocky Ithaca! Now you are burnt-out husks, your spirits haggard, sere, always brooding over your wanderings long and hard, your hearts never lifting with any joy — you've suffered far too much.' So she enticed and won our battle-hardened spirits over. And there we sat at ease, day in, day out, till a year had run its course, feasting on sides of meat and drafts of heady wine ... But then, when the year was through and the seasons wheeled by and the months waned and the long days came round again, my loyal comrades took me aside and prodded, 'Captain, this is madness! High time you thought of your own home at last, if it really z?your fate to make it back alive and reach your well-built house and native land.' Their urging brought my stubborn spirit round. So all that day till the sun went down we sat and feasted on sides of meat and heady wine. Then when the sun had set and night came on the men lay down to sleep in the shadowed halls but 1 went up to that luxurious bed of Circe's, hugged her by the knees and the goddess heard my winging supplication: 'Circe, now make good a promise you gave me once — it's time to help me home. My heart longs to be home, my comrades' hearts as well. They wear me down, pleading with me whenever you're away.' So 1 pressed and the lustrous goddess answered me in turn: 'Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, old campaigner, stay on no more in my house against your will. But first another journey calls. You must travel down to the House of Death and the awesome one, Persephone, there to consult the ghost of Tiresias, seer of Thebes, the great blind prophet whose mind remains unshaken. Even in death — Persephone has given him wisdom, everlasting vision to him and him alone ... the rest of the dead are empty, flitting shades.' So she said and crushed the heart inside me. I knelt in her bed and wept. I'd no desire to go on living and see the rising light of day. But once I'd had my fill of tears and writhing there, at last I found the words to venture, Circe, Circe, who can pilot us on that journey? Who has ever reached the House of Death in a black ship?' The lustrous goddess answered, never pausing, 'Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, born for exploits, let no lack of a pilot at the helm concern you, no, just step your mast and spread your white sail wide — sit back and the North Wind will speed you on your way. But once your vessel has cut across the Ocean River you will raise a desolate coast and Persephone's Grove, her tall black poplars, willows whose fruit dies young. Beach your vessel hard by the Ocean's churning shore and make your own way down to the moldering House of Death. And there into Acheron, the Flood of Grief, two rivers flow, the torrent River of Fire, the wailing River of Tears that branches off from Styx, the Stream of Hate, and a stark crag looms where the two rivers thunder down and meet. Once there, go forward, hero. Do as 1 say now. Dig a trench of about a forearm's depth and length and around it pour libations out to all the dead — first with milk and honey, and then with mellow wine, then water third and last, and sprinkle glistening barley over it all, and vow again and again to all the dead, to the drifting, listless spirits of their ghosts, that once you return to Ithaca you will slaughter a barren heifer in your halls, the best you have, and load a pyre with treasures — and to Tiresias, alone, apart, you will offer a sleek black ram, the pride of all your herds. And once your prayers have invoked the nations of the dead in their dim glory, slaughter a ram and black ewe, turning both their heads toward Erebus, but turn your head away, looking toward the Ocean River. Suddenly then the countless shades of the dead and gone will surge around you there. But order your men at once to flay the sheep that lie before you, killed by your ruthless blade, and burn them both, and then say prayers to the gods, to the almighty god of death and dread Persephone. But you — draw your sharp sword from beside your hip, sit down on alert there, and never let the ghosts of the shambling, shiftless dead come near that blood till you have questioned Tiresias yourself. Soon, soon the great seer will appear before you, captain of armies: he will tell you the way to go, the stages of your voyage, how you can cross the swarming sea and reach home at last.' And with those words Dawn rose on her golden throne and Circe dressed me quickly in sea-cloak and shirt while the queen slipped on a loose, glistening robe, filmy, a joy to the eye, and round her waist she ran a brocaded golden belt and over her head a scarf to shield her brow. And 1 strode on through the halls to stir my men, hovering over each with a winning word: 'Up now! No more lazing away in sleep, we must set sail — Queen Circe has shown the way . ' 1 brought them round, my hardy friends-in-arms, but not even from there could 1 get them safely off without a loss ... There was a man, Elpenor, the youngest in our ranks, none too brave in battle, none too sound in mind. He'd strayed from his mates in Circe's magic halls and keen for the cool night air, sodden with wine he'd bedded down on her roofs. But roused by the shouts and tread of marching men, he leapt up with a start at dawn but still so dazed he forgot to climb back down again by the long ladder — headfirst from the roof he plunged, his neck snapped from the backbone, his soul flew down to Death. Once on our way, I gave the men their orders: 'You think we are headed home, our own dear land? Well, Circe sets us a rather different course ... down to the House of Death and the awesome one, Persephone, there to consult the ghost of Tiresias, seer of Thebes. ' So 1 said, and it broke my shipmates' hearts. They sank down on the ground, moaning, tore their hair. But it gained us nothing — what good can come of grief? Back to the swift ship at the water's edge we went, our spirits deep in anguish, faces wet with tears. But Circe got to the dark hull before us, tethered a ram and black ewe close by — slipping past unseen. Who can glimpse a god who wants to be invisible gliding here and there?" The Kingdom of the Dead "Now down we came to the ship at the water's edge, we hauled and launched her into the sunlit breakers first, stepped the mast in the black craft and set our sail and loaded the sheep aboard, the ram and ewe, then we ourselves embarked, streaming tears, our hearts weighed down with anguish ... But Circe the awesome nymph with lovely braids who speaks with human voice, sent us a hardy shipmate, yes, a fresh following wind ruffling up in our wake, bellying out our sail to drive our blue prow on as we, securing the running gear from stem to stern, sat back while the wind and helmsman kept her true on course. The sail stretched taut as she cut the sea all day and the sun sank and the roads of the world grew dark. And she made the outer limits, the Ocean River's bounds where Cimmerian people have their homes — their realm and city shrouded in mist and cloud. The eye of the Sun can never flash his rays through the dark and bring them light, not when he climbs the starry skies or when he wheels back down from the heights to touch the earth once more — an endless, deadly night overhangs those wretched men. There, gaining that point, we beached our craft and herding out the sheep, we picked our way by the Ocean's banks until we gained the place that Circe made our goal. Here at the spot Perimedes and Eurylochus held the victims fast, and 1, drawing my sharp sword from beside my hip, dug a trench of about a forearm's depth and length and around it poured libations out to all the dead, first with milk and honey, and then with mellow wine, then water third and last, and sprinkled glistening barley over it all, and time and again 1 vowed to all the dead, to the drifting, listless spirits of their ghosts, that once 1 returned to Ithaca 1 would slaughter a barren heifer in my halls, the best 1 had, and load a pyre with treasures — and to Tiresias, alone, apart, 1 would offer a sleek black ram, the pride of all my herds. And once my vows and prayers had invoked the nations of the dead, 1 took the victims, over the trench 1 cut their throats and the dark blood flowed in — and up out of Erebus they came, flocking toward me now, the ghosts of the dead and gone ... Brides and unwed youths and old men who had suffered much and girls with their tender hearts freshly scarred by sorrow and great armies of battle dead, stabbed by bronze spears, men of war still wrapped in bloody armor — ^thousands swarming around the trench from every side — unearthly cries — blanching terror gripped me! 1 ordered the men at once to flay the sheep that lay before us, killed by my ruthless blade. and burn them both, and then say prayers to the gods, to the almighty god of death and dread Persephone. But I, the sharp sword drawn from beside my hip, sat down on alert there and never let the ghosts of the shambling, shiftless dead come near that blood till 1 had questioned Tiresias myself. But first the ghost of Elpenor, my companion, came toward me. He'd not been buried under the wide ways of earth, not yet, we'd left his body in Circe's house, unwept, unburied — this other labor pressed us. But 1 wept to see him now, pity touched my heart and 1 called out a winged word to him there: Elpenor, how did you travel down to the world of darkness? Faster on foot, 1 see, than 1 in my black ship.' My comrade groaned as he offered me an answer: Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, old campaigner, the doom of an angry god, and god knows how much wine — they were my ruin, captain ... I'd bedded down on the roof of Circe's house but never thought to climb back down again by the long ladder — headfirst from the roof 1 plunged, my neck snapped from the backbone, my soul flew down to Death. Now, 1 beg you by those you left behind, so far from here, your wife, your father who bred and reared you as a boy, and Telemachus, left at home in your halls, your only son. Well 1 know when you leave this lodging of the dead that you and your ship will put ashore again at the island of Aeaea — ^then and there, my lord, remember me, 1 beg you! Don't sail off and desert me, left behind unwept, unburied, don't, or my curse may draw god's fury on your head. No, burn me in full armor, all my harness, heap my mound by the churning gray surf — a man whose luck ran out — so even men to come will learn my story. Perform my rites, and plant on my tomb that oar I swung with mates when I rowed among the living. ' 'All this, my unlucky friend,' 1 reassured him, '1 will do for you. 1 won't forget a thing.' So we sat and faced each other, trading our bleak parting words, 1 on my side, holding my sword above the blood, he across from me there, my comrade's phantom dragging out his story. But look, the ghost of my mother came, my mother, dead and gone now ... Anticleia — daughter of that great heart Autolycus — whom 1 had left alive when 1 sailed for sacred Troy. 1 broke into tears to see her here, but filled with pity, even throbbing with grief, 1 would not let her ghost approach the blood till 1 had questioned Tiresias myself. At last he came. The shade of the famous Theban prophet, holding a golden scepter, knew me at once and hailed me: 'Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, master of exploits, man of pain, what now, what brings you here, forsaking the light of day to see this joyless kingdom of the dead? Stand back from the trench — put up your sharp sword so 1 can drink the blood and tell you all the truth.' Moving back, 1 thrust my silver-studded sword deep in its sheath, and once he had drunk the dark blood the words came ringing from the prophet in his power: 'A sweet smooth journey home, renowned Odysseus, that is what you seek, but a god will make it hard for you — 1 know — you will never escape the one who shakes the earth, quaking with anger at you still, still enraged because you blinded the Cyclops, his dear son. Even so, you and your crew may still reach home, suffering all the way, if you only have the power to curb their wild desire and curb your own, what's more, from the day your good trim vessel first puts in at Thrinacia Island, flees the cruel blue sea. There you will find them grazing, herds and fat flocks, the cattle of Helios, god of the sun who sees all, hears all things. Leave the beasts unharmed, your mind set on home, and you a//may still reach Ithaca — bent with hardship, true — but harm them in any way, and 1 can see it now: your ship destroyed, your men destroyed as well. And even if you escape, you'll come home late and come a broken man — all shipmates lost, alone in a stranger's ship — and you will find a world of pain at home, crude, arrogant men devouring all your goods, courting your noble wife, offering gifts to win her. No doubt you will pay them back in blood when you come home! But once you have killed those suitors in your halls — by stealth or in open fight with slashing bronze — go forth once more, you must ... carry your well-planed oar until you come to a race of people who know nothing of the sea, whose food is never seasoned with salt, strangers all to ships with their crimson prows and long slim oars, wings that make ships fly. And here is your sign — unmistakable, clear, so clear you cannot miss it: When another traveler falls in with you and calls that weight across your shoulder a fan to winnow grain, then plant your bladed, balanced oar in the earth and sacrifice fine beasts to the lord god of the sea, Poseidon — a ram, a bull and a ramping wild boar — then journey home and render noble offerings up to the deathless gods who rule the vaulting skies, to all the gods in order. And at last your own death will steal upon you ... a gentle, painless death, far from the sea it comes to take you down, borne down with the years in ripe old age with all your people there in blessed peace around you. All that 1 have told you will come true. ' 'OhTiresias/ 1 replied as the prophet finished, surely the gods have spun this out as fate, the gods themselves. But tell me one thing more, and tell me clearly. 1 see the ghost of my long-lost mother here before me. Dead, crouching close to the blood in silence, she cannot bear to look me in the eyes — her own son — or speak a word to me. How, lord, can 1 make her know me for the man 1 am?' 'One rule there is,' the famous seer explained, and simple for me to say and you to learn. Any one of the ghosts you let approach the blood will speak the truth to you. Anyone you refuse will turn and fade away.' And with those words, now that his prophecies had closed, the awesome shade of lord Tiresias strode back to the House of Death. But 1 kept watch there, steadfast till my mother approached and drank the dark, clouding blood. She knew me at once and wailed out in grief and her words came winging toward me, flying home: 'Oh my son — what brings you down to the world of death and darkness? You are still alive! It's hard for the living to catch a glimpse of this ... Great rivers flow between us, terrible waters, the Ocean first of all — no one could ever ford that stream on foot, only aboard some sturdy craft. Have you just come from Troy, wandering long years with your men and ship? Not yet returned to Ithaca? You've still not seen your wife inside your halls?' 'Mother,' 1 replied, '1 had to venture down to the House of Death, to consult the shade of Tiresias, seer of Thebes. Never yet have 1 neared Achaea, never once set foot on native ground, always wandering — endless hardship from that day I first set sail with King Agamemnon bound for Troy, the stallion-land, to fight the Trojans there. But tell me about yourself and spare me nothing. What form of death overcame you, what laid you low, some long slow illness? Or did Artemis showering arrows come with her painless shafts and bring you down? Tell me of father, tell of the son 1 left behind: do my royal rights still lie in their safekeeping? Or does some stranger hold the throne by now because men think that I'll come home no more? Please, tell me about my wife, her turn of mind, her thoughts ... still standing fast beside our son, still guarding our great estates, secure as ever now? Or has she wed some other countryman at last, the finest prince among them?' 'Surely, surely,' my noble mother answered quickly, she's still waiting there in your halls, poor woman, suffering so, her life an endless hardship like your own ... wasting away the nights, weeping away the days. No one has taken over your royal rights, not yet. Telemachus still holds your great estates in peace, he attends the public banquets shared with all, the feasts a man of justice should enjoy, for every lord invites him. As for your father, he keeps to his own farm — he never goes to town — with no bed for him there, no blankets, glossy throws; all winter long he sleeps in the lodge with servants, in the ashes by the fire, his body wrapped in rags. But when summer comes and the bumper crops of harvest, any spot on the rising ground of his vineyard rows he makes his bed, heaped high with fallen leaves, and there he lies in anguish ... with his old age bearing hard upon him, too, and his grief grows as he longs for your return. And 1 with the same grief, 1 died and met my fate. No sharp-eyed Huntress showering arrows through the halls approached and brought me down with painless shafts. nor did some hateful illness strike me, that so often devastates the body, drains our limbs of power. No, it was my longing for you, my shining Odysseus — you and your quickness, you and your gentle ways — that tore away my life that had been sweet.' And 1, my mind in turmoil, how 1 longed to embrace my mother's spirit, dead as she was! Three times 1 rushed toward her, desperate to hold her, three times she fluttered through my fingers, sifting away like a shadow, dissolving like a dream, and each time the grief cut to the heart, sharper, yes, and 1, 1 cried out to her, words winging into the darkness: 'Mother — why not wait for me? How 1 long to hold you! — so even here, in the House of Death, we can fling our loving arms around each other, take some joy in the tears that numb the heart. Or is this just some wraith that great Persephone sends my way to make me ache with sorrow all the more?' My noble mother answered me at once: 'My son, my son, the unluckiest man alive! This is no deception sent by Queen Persephone, this is just the way of mortals when we die. Sinews no longer bind the flesh and bones together — the fire in all its fury burns the body down to ashes once life slips from the white bones, and the spirit, rustling, flitters away ... flown like a dream. But you must long for the daylight. Go, quickly. Remember all these things so one day you can tell them to your wife. ' And so we both confided, trading parting words, and there slowly came a grand array of women, all sent before me now by august Persephone, and all were wives and daughters once of princes. They swarmed in a flock around the dark blood while 1 searched for a way to question each alone. and the more I thought, the more this seemed the best: Drawing forth the long sharp sword from beside my hip, I would not let them drink the dark blood, all in a rush, and so they waited, coming forward one after another. Each declared her lineage, and 1 explored them all. And the first 1 saw there? Tyro, born of kings, who said her father was that great lord Salmoneus, said that she was the wife of Cretheus, Aeolus' son. And once she fell in love with the river god, Enipeus, far the clearest river flowing across the earth, and so she'd haunt Enipeus' glinting streams, till taking his shape one day the god who girds the earth and makes it tremble bedded her where the swirling river rushes out to sea, and a surging wave reared up, high as a mountain, dark, arching over to hide the god and mortal girl together. Loosing her virgin belt, he lapped her round in sleep and when the god had consummated his work of love he took her by the hand and hailed her warmly: 'Rejoice in our love, my lady! And when this year has run its course you will give birth to glorious children — bedding down with the gods is never barren, futile — and you must tend them, breed and rear them well. Now home you go, and restrain yourself, 1 say, never breathe your lover's name but know — 1 am Poseidon, god who rocks the earth!' With that he dove back in the heaving waves and she conceived for the god and bore him Pelias, Neleus, and both grew up to be stalwart aides of Zeus almighty, both men alike. Pelias lived on the plains of lolcos, rich in sheepflocks, Neleus lived in sandy Pylos. And the noble queen bore sons to Cretheus too: Aeson, Pheres and Amy thaon, exultant charioteer. And after Tyro 1 saw Asopus' daughter Antiope, proud she'd spent a night in the arms of Zeus himself and borne the god twin sons, Amphion and Zethus, the first to build the footings of seven-gated Thebes, her bastions too, for lacking ramparts none could live in a place so vast, so open — strong as both men were. And 1 saw Alcmena next, Amphitryon's wife, who slept in the clasp of Zeus and merged in love and brought forth Heracles, rugged will and lion heart. And 1 saw Megara too, magnanimous Creon's daughter wed to the stalwart Heracles, the hero never daunted. And 1 saw the mother of Oedipus, beautiful Epicaste. What a monstrous thing she did, in all innocence — she married her own son ... who'd killed his father, then he married her! But the gods soon made it known to all mankind. So he in growing pain ruled on in beloved Thebes, lording Cadmus' people — thanks to the gods' brutal plan — while she went down to Death who guards the massive gates. Lashing a noose to a steep rafter, there she hanged aloft, strangling in all her anguish, leaving her son to bear the world of horror a mother's Furies bring to life. And 1 saw magnificent Chloris, the one whom Neleus wooed and won with a hoard of splendid gifts, so dazzled by her beauty years ago ... the youngest daughter of lasus' son Amphion, the great Minyan king who ruled Orchomenos once. She was his queen in Pylos, she bore him shining sons, Nestor and Chromius, Periclymenus too, good prince. And after her sons she bore a daughter, majestic Pero, the marvel of her time, courted by all the young lords round about. But Neleus would not give her to any suitor, none but the man who might drive home the herds that powerful Iphiclus had stolen. Lurching, broad in the brow, those longhorned beasts, and no small task to round them up from Phylace. Only the valiant seer Melampus volunteered — would drive them home — but a god's iron sentence bound him fast: barbarous herdsmen dragged him off in chains. Yet when the months and days had run their course and the year wheeled round and the seasons came again, then mighty Iphiclus loosed the prophet's shackles, once he had told him all the gods' decrees. And so the will of Zeus was done at last. And 1 saw Leda next, Tyndareus' wife, who'd borne the king two sons, intrepid twins. Castor, breaker of horses, and the hardy boxer Polydeuces, both buried now in the life-giving earth though still alive. Even under the earth Zeus grants them that distinction: one day alive, the next day dead, each twin by turns, they both hold honors equal to the gods'. And 1 saw Iphimedeia next, Aloeus' wife, who claimed she lay in the Sea-lord's loving waves and gave the god two sons, but they did not live long, Otus staunch as a god and far-famed Ephialtes. They were the tallest men the fertile earth has borne, the handsomest too, by far, aside from renowned Orion. Nine yards across they measured, even at nine years old, nine fathoms tall they towered. They even threatened the deathless gods they'd storm Olympus' heights with the pounding rush and grinding shock of battle. They were wild to pile Ossa upon Olympus, then on Ossa Pelion dense with timber — their toeholds up the heavens. And they'd have won the day if they had reached peak strength but Apollo the son of Zeus, whom sleek-haired Leto bore, laid both low before their beards had sprouted, covering cheek and chin with a fresh crop of down. Phaedra and Procris too 1 saw, and lovely Ariadne, daughter of Minos, that harsh king. One day Theseus tried to spirit her off from Crete to Athens' sacred heights, but he got no joy from her. Artemis killed her first on wave-washed Dia's shores, accused by Dionysus. And 1 saw Clymene, Maera and loathsome Eriphyle — bribed with a golden necklace to lure her lawful husband to his death ... But the whole cortege 1 could never tally, never name, not all the daughters and wives of great men 1 saw there. Long before that, the godsent night would ebb away. But the time has come for sleep, either with friends aboard your swift ship or here in your own house. My passage home will rest with the gods and you." Odysseus paused ... They all fell silent, hushed, his story holding them spellbound down the shadowed halls till the white-armed queen Arete suddenly burst out, "Phaeacians! How does this man impress you now, his looks, his build, the balanced mind inside him? The stranger is my guest but each of you princes shares the honor here. So let's not be too hasty to send him on his way, and don't scrimp on his gifts. His need is great, great as the riches piled up in your houses, thanks to the gods' good will." Following her, the old revered Echeneus added his support, the eldest lord on the island of Phaeacia: "Friends, the words of our considerate queen — they never miss the mark or fail our expectations. So do as Arete says, though on Alcinous here depend all words and action." "And so it will be"— Alcinous stepped in grandly — "sure as 1 am alive and rule our island men who love their oars! Our guest, much as he longs for passage home, must stay and wait it out here till tomorrow, till 1 can collect his whole array of parting gifts. His send-off rests with every noble here but with me most of all: 1 hold the reins of power in the realm. " Odysseus, deft and tactful, echoed back, "Alcinous, majesty, shining among your island people, if you would urge me now to stay here one whole year then speed me home weighed down with lordly gifts, I'd gladly have it so. Better by far, I'd say. The fuller my arms on landing there at home, the more respected, well-received I'd be by all who saw me sailing back to Ithaca." "Ah Odysseus, " Alcinous replied, "one look at you and we know that you are no one who would cheat us — no fraud, such as the dark soil breeds and spreads across the face of the earth these days. Crowds of vagabonds frame their lies so tightly none can test them. But you, what grace you give your words, and what good sense within! You have told your story with all a singer's skill, the miseries you endured, your great Achaeans too. But come now, tell me truly: your godlike comrades — did you see any heroes down in the House of Death, any who sailed with you and met their doom at Troy? The night's still young, I'd say the night is endless. For us in the palace now, it's hardly time for sleep. Keep telling us your adventures — ^they are wonderful. 1 could hold out here till Dawn's first light if only you could bear, here in our halls, to tell the tale of all the pains you suffered. " So the man of countless exploits carried on: "Alcinous, majesty, shining among your island people, there is a time for many words, a time for sleep as well. But if you insist on hearing more, I'd never stint on telling my own tale and those more painful still, the griefs of my comrades, dead in the war's wake, who escaped the battle-cries of Trojan armies only to die in blood at journey's end — thanks to a vicious woman's will. Now then, no sooner had Queen Persephone driven off the ghosts of lovely women, scattering left and right, than forward marched the shade of Atreus' son Agamemnon, fraught with grief and flanked by all his comrades, troops of his men-at-arms who died beside him, who met their fate in lord Aegisthus' halls. He knew me at once, as soon as he drank the blood, and wailed out, shrilly; tears sprang to his eyes, he thrust his arms toward me, keen to embrace me there — no use — the great force was gone, the strength lost forever, now, that filled his rippling limbs in the old days. 1 wept at the sight, my heart went out to the man, my words too, in a winging flight of pity: 'Famous Atrides, lord of men Agamemnon! What fatal stroke of destiny brought you down? Wrecked in the ships when lord Poseidon roused some punishing blast of stormwinds, gust on gust? Or did ranks of enemies mow you down on land as you tried to raid and cut off herds and flocks or fought to win their city, take their women?' The field marshal's ghost replied at once: 'Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, mastermind of war, 1 was not wrecked in the ships when lord Poseidon roused some punishing blast of stormwinds, gust on gust, nor did ranks of enemies mow me down on land — Aegisthus hatched my doom and my destruction, killed me, he with my own accursed wife ... he invited me to his palace, sat me down to feast then cut me down as a man cuts down some ox at the trough! So 1 died — a wretched, ignominious death — and round me all my comrades killed, no mercy, one after another, just like white-tusked boars butchered in some rich lord of power's halls for a wedding, banquet or groaning public feast. You in your day have witnessed hundreds slaughtered, killed in single combat or killed in pitched battle, true, but if you'd laid eyes on thisiX. would have wrenched your heart- how we sprawled by the mixing-bowl and loaded tables there, throughout the palace, the whole floor awash with blood. But the death-shriek of Cassandra, Priam's daughter — most pitiful thing 1 heard! My treacherous queen, Clytemnestra, killed her over my body, yes, and 1, lifting my fists, beat them down on the ground, dying, dying, writhing around the sword. But she, that whore, she turned her back on me, well on my way to Death — she even lacked the heart to seal my eyes with her hand or close my jaws. So, there's nothing more deadly, bestial than a woman set on works like these — what a monstrous thing she plotted, slaughtered her own lawful husband! Why, 1 expected, at least, some welcome home from all my children, all my household slaves when 1 came sailing back again ... But she — the queen hell-bent on outrage — bathes in shame not only herself but the whole breed of womankind, even the honest ones to come, forever down the years!' So he declared and 1 cried out, 'How terrible! Zeus from the very start, the thunder king has hated the race of Atreus with a vengeance — his trustiest weapon women's twisted wiles. What armies of us died for the sake of Helen ... Clytemnestra schemed your death while you were worlds away!' 'True, true,' Agamemnon's ghost kept pressing on, 'so even your own wife — never indulge her too far. Never reveal the whole truth, whatever you may know; just tell her a part of it, be sure to hide the rest. Not that you, Odysseus, will be murdered by your wife. She's much too steady, her feeUngs run too deep, Icarius' daughter Penelope, that wise woman. She was a young bride, I well remember ... we left her behind when we went off to war, with an infant boy she nestled at her breast. That boy must sit and be counted with the men now — happy man! His beloved father will come sailing home and see his son, and he will embrace his father, that is only right. But myv^iie — she never even let me feast my eyes on my own son; she killed me first, his father! 1 tell you this — bear it in mind, you must — when you reach your homeland steer your ship into port in secret, never out in the open ... the time for trusting women's gone forever! Enough. Come, tell me this, and be precise. Have you heard news of my son? Where's he living now? Perhaps in Orchomenos, perhaps in sandy Pylos or off in the Spartan plains with Menelaus? He's not dead yet, my Prince Orestes, no, he's somewhere on the earth.' So he probed but 1 cut it short: 'Atrides, why ask me that? 1 know nothing, whether he's dead or alive. It's wrong to lead you on with idle words. ' So we stood there, trading heartsick stories, deep in grief, as the tears streamed down our faces. But now there came the ghosts of Peleus' son Achilles, Patroclus, fearless Antilochus — and Great Ajax too, the first in stature, first in build and bearing of all the Argives after Peleus' matchless son. The ghost of the splendid runner knew me at once and hailed me with a flight of mournful questions: 'Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, man of tactics, reckless friend, what next? What greater feat can that cunning head contrive? What daring brought you down to the House of Death? — where the senseless, burnt-out wraiths of mortals make their home.' The voice of his spirit paused, and 1 was quick to answer: 'Achilles, son of Peleus, greatest of the Achaeans, 1 had to consult Tiresias, driven here by hopes he would help me journey home to rocky Ithaca. Never yet have 1 neared Achaea, never once set foot on native ground ... my life is endless trouble. But you, Achilles, there's not a man in the world more blest than you — there never has been, never will be one. Time was, when you were alive, we Argives honored you as a god, and now down here, 1 see, you lord it over the dead in all your power. So grieve no more at dying, great Achilles.' 1 reassured the ghost, but he broke out, protesting, 'No winning words about death to me, shining Odysseus! By god, I'd rather slave on earth for another man — some dirt-poor tenant farmer who scrapes to keep alive — than rule down here over all the breathless dead. But come, tell me the news about my gallant son. Did he make his way to the wars, did the boy become a champion — yes or no? Tell me of noble Peleus, any word you've heard — still holding pride of place among his Myrmidon hordes, or do they despise the man in Hellas and in Phthia because old age has lamed his arms and legs? For 1 no longer stand in the light of day — the man 1 was — comrade-in-arms to help my father as once 1 helped our armies, killing the best fighters Troy could field in the wide world up there ... Oh to arrive at father's house — ^the man I was, for one brief day — I'd make my fury and my hands. invincible hands, a thing of terror to all those men who abuse the king with force and wrest away his honor!' So he grieved but 1 tried to lend him heart: About noble Peleus 1 can tell you nothing, but about your own dear son, Neoptolemus, 1 can report the whole story, as you wish. 1 myself, in my trim ship, 1 brought him out of Scyros to join the Argives under arms. And dug in around Troy, debating battle-tactics, he always spoke up first, and always on the mark — godlike Nestor and 1 alone excelled the boy. Yes, and when our armies fought on the plain of Troy he'd never hang back with the main force of men — he'd always charge ahead, giving ground to no one in his fury, and scores of men he killed in bloody combat. How could 1 list them all, name them all, now, the fighting ranks he leveled, battling for the Argives? But what a soldier he laid low with a bronze sword: the hero Eurypylus, Telephus' son, and round him troops of his own Cetean comrades slaughtered, lured to war by the bribe his mother took. The only man 1 saw to put Eurypylus in the shade was Memnon, son of the Morning. Again, when our champions climbed inside the horse that Epeus built with labor, and 1 held full command to spring our packed ambush open or keep it sealed, all our lords and captains were wiping off their tears, knees shaking beneath each man — but not your son. Never once did 1 see his glowing skin go pale; he never flicked a tear from his cheeks, no, he kept on begging me there to let him burst from the horse, kept gripping his hilted sword, his heavy bronze- tipped javelin, keen to loose his fighting fury against the Trojans. Then, once we'd sacked King Priam's craggy city, laden with his fair share and princely prize he boarded his own ship, his body all unscarred. Not a wound from a flying spear or a sharp sword, cut-and-thrust close up — the common marks of war. Random, raging Ares plays no favorites.' So 1 said and off he went, the ghost of the great runner, Aeacus' grandson loping with long strides across the fields of asphodel, triumphant in all 1 had told him of his son, his gallant, glorious son. Now the rest of the ghosts, the dead and gone came swarming up around me — deep in sorrow there, each asking about the grief that touched him most. Only the ghost of Great Ajax, son of Telamon, kept his distance, blazing with anger at me still for the victory 1 had won by the ships that time 1 pressed my claim for the arms of Prince Achilles. His queenly mother had set them up as prizes, Pallas and captive Trojans served as judges. Would to god I'd never won such trophies! All for them the earth closed over Ajax, that proud hero Ajax ... greatest in build, greatest in works of war of all the Argives after Peleus' matchless son. 1 cried out to him now, 1 tried to win him over: 'Ajax, son of noble Telamon, still determined, even in death, not once to forget that rage you train on me for those accursed arms? The gods set up that prize to plague the Achaeans — so great a tower of strength we lost when you went down! For your death we grieved as we did for Achilles' death — we grieved incessantly, true, and none's to blame but Zeus, who hated Achaea's fighting spearmen so intensely, Zeus sealed your doom. Come closer, king, and listen to my story. Conquer your rage, your blazing, headstrong pride!' So I cried out but Ajax answered not a word. He stalked off toward Erebus, into the dark to join the other lost, departed dead. Yet now, despite his anger, he might have spoken to me, or I to him, but the heart inside me stirred with some desire to see the ghosts of others dead and gone. And I saw Minos there, illustrious son of Zeus, firmly enthroned, holding his golden scepter, judging all the dead ... Some on their feet, some seated, all clustering round the king of justice, pleading for his verdicts reached in the House of Death with its all-embracing gates. 1 next caught sight of Orion, that huge hunter, rounding up on the fields of asphodel those wild beasts the man in life cut down on the lonely mountain-slopes, brandishing in his hands the bronze-studded club that time can never shatter. 1 saw Tityus too, son of the mighty goddess Earth — sprawling there on the ground, spread over nine acres — ^two vultures hunched on either side of him, digging into his liver, beaking deep in the blood-sac, and he with his frantic hands could never beat them off, for he had once dragged off the famous consort of Zeus in all her glory, Leto, threading her way toward Pytho's ridge, over the lovely dancing-rings of Panopeus. And 1 saw Tantalus too, bearing endless torture. He stood erect in a pool as the water lapped his chin — parched, he burned to drink, but he could not reach the surface, no, time and again the old man stooped, craving a sip, time and again the water vanished, swallowed down, laying bare the caked black earth at his feet — some spirit drank it dry. And over his head leafy trees dangled their fruit from high aloft, pomegranates and pears, and apples glowing red. succulent figs and olives swelling sleek and dark, but soon as the old man would strain to clutch them fast a gust would toss them up to the lowering dark clouds. And 1 saw Sisyphus too, bound to his own torture, grappling his monstrous boulder with both arms working, heaving, hands struggling, legs driving, he kept on thrusting the rock uphill toward the brink, but just as it teetered, set to topple over — time and again the immense weight of the thing would wheel it back and the ruthless boulder would bound and tumble down to the plain again — so once again he would heave, would struggle to thrust it up, sweat drenching his body, dust swirling above his head. And next 1 caught a glimpse of powerful Heracles — his ghost, 1 mean: the man himself delights in the grand feasts of the deathless gods on high, wed to Hebe, famed for her lithe, alluring ankles, the daughter of mighty Zeus and Hera shod in gold. Around him cries of the dead rang out like cries of birds, scattering left and right in horror as on he came like night, naked bow in his grip, an arrow grooved on the bowstring, glaring round him fiercely, forever poised to shoot. A terror too, that sword-belt sweeping across his chest, a baldric of solid gold emblazoned with awesome work ... bears and ramping boars and lions with wild, fiery eyes, and wars, routs and battles, massacres, butchered men. May the craftsman who forged that masterpiece — whose skills could conjure up a belt like that — never forge another! Heracles knew me at once, at first glance, and hailed me with a winging burst of pity: 'Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus famed for exploits, luckless man, you too? Braving out a fate as harsh as the fate 1 bore, alive in the light of day? Son of Zeus that 1 was, my torments never ended, forced to slave for a man not half the man 1 was: he saddled me with the worst heartbreaking labors. Why, he sent me down here once, to retrieve the hound that guards the dead — no harder task for me, he thought — but 1 dragged the great beast up from the underworld to earth and Hermes and gleaming-eyed Athena blazed the way!' With that he turned and back he went to the House of Death but 1 held fast in place, hoping others might still come, shades of famous heroes, men who died in the old days and ghosts of an even older age 1 longed to see, Theseus and Pirithous, the gods' own radiant sons. But before 1 could, the dead came surging round me, hordes of them, thousands raising unearthly cries, and blanching terror gripped me — panicked now that Queen Persephone might send up from Death some monstrous head, some Gorgon's staring face! 1 rushed back to my ship, commanded all hands to take to the decks and cast off cables quickly. They swung aboard at once, they sat to the oars in ranks and a strong tide of the Ocean River swept her on downstream, sped by our rowing first, then by a fresh fair wind." The Cattle of the Sun "Now when our ship had left the Ocean River rolling in her wake and launched out into open sea with its long swells to reach the island of Aeaea — east where the Dawn forever young has home and dancing-rings and the Sun his risings — heading in we beached our craft on the sands, the crews swung out on the low sloping shore and there we fell asleep, awaiting Dawn's first light. As soon as Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone again 1 dispatched some men to Circe's halls to bring the dead Elpenor's body. We cut logs in haste and out on the island's sharpest jutting headland held his funeral rites in sorrow, streaming tears. Once we'd burned the dead man and the dead man's armor, heaping his grave-mound, hauling a stone that coped it well. we planted his balanced oar aloft to crown his tomb. And so we saw to his rites, each step in turn. Nor did our coming back from Death escape Circe — she hurried toward us, decked in rich regalia, handmaids following close with trays of bread and meats galore and glinting ruddy wine. And the lustrous goddess, standing in our midst, hailed us warmly: Ah my darling, reckless friends! You who ventured down to the House of Death alive, doomed to die twice over — others die just once. Come, take some food and drink some wine, rest here the livelong day and then, tomorrow at daybreak, you must sail. But 1 will set you a course and chart each seamark, so neither on sea nor land will some new trap ensnare you in trouble, make you suffer more.' Her foresight won our fighting spirits over. So all that day till the sun went down we sat and feasted on sides of meat and heady wine, and then when the sun had set and night came on the men lay down to sleep by the ship's stern-cables. But Circe, taking me by the hand, drew me away from all my shipmates there and sat me down and lying beside me probed me for details. 1 told her the whole story, start to finish, then the queenly goddess laid my course: 'Your descent to the dead is over, true, but listen closely to what 1 tell you now and god himself will bring it back to mind. First you will raise the island of the Sirens, those creatures who spellbind any man alive, whoever comes their way. Whoever draws too close, off guard, and catches the Sirens' voices in the air — no sailing home for him, no wife rising to meet him, no happy children beaming up at their father's face. The high, thrilling song of the Sirens will transfix him. lolling there in their meadow, round them heaps of corpses, rotting away, rags of skin shriveling on their bones ... Race straight past that coast! Soften some beeswax and stop your shipmates' ears so none can hear, none of the crew, but if you are bent on hearing, have them tie you hand and foot in the swift ship, erect at the mast-block, lashed by ropes to the mast so you can hear the Sirens' song to your heart's content. But if you plead, commanding your men to set you free, then they must lash you faster, rope on rope. But once your crew has rowed you past the Sirens a choice of routes is yours. 1 cannot advise you which to take, or lead you through it all — you must decide for yourself — but 1 can tell you the ways of either course. On one side beetling cliffs shoot up, and against them pound the huge roaring breakers of blue-eyed Amphitrite — the Clashing Rocks they're called by all the blissful gods. Not even birds can escape them, no, not even the doves that veer and fly ambrosia home to Father Zeus: even of those the sheer Rocks always pick off one and Father wings one more to keep the number up. No ship of men has ever approached and slipped past — always some disaster — big timbers and sailors' corpses whirled away by the waves and lethal blasts of fire. One ship alone, one deep-sea craft sailed clear, the Arffo, sung by the world, when heading home from Aeetes' shores. And 5Ae would have crashed against those giant rocks and sunk at once if Hera, for love of Jason, had not sped her through. On the other side loom two enormous crags ... One thrusts into the vaulting sky its jagged peak, hooded round with a dark cloud that never leaves — no clear bright air can ever bathe its crown, not even in summer's heat or harvest-time. No man on earth could scale it, mount its crest. not even with twenty hands and twenty feet for cUmbing, the rock's so smooth, like dressed and burnished stone. And halfway up that cliff side stands a fog-bound cavern gaping west toward Erebus, realm of death and darkness — past it, great Odysseus, you should steer your ship. No rugged young archer could hit that yawning cave with a winged arrow shot from off the decks. Scylla lurks inside it — the yelping horror, yelping, no louder than any suckling pup, but she's a grisly monster, 1 assure you. No one could look on her with any joy, not even a god who meets her face-to-face ... She has twelve legs, all writhing, dangling down and six long swaying necks, a hideous head on each, each head barbed with a triple row of fangs, thickset, packed tight — armed to the hilt with black death! Holed up in the cavern's bowels from her waist down she shoots out her heads, out of that terrifying pit, angling right from her nest, wildly sweeping the reefs for dolphins, dogfish or any bigger quarry she can drag from the thousands Amphitrite spawns in groaning seas. No mariners yet can boast they've raced their ship past Scylla's lair without some mortal blow — with each of her six heads she snatches up a man from the dark-prowed craft and whisks him off. The other crag is lower — you will see, Odysseus — though both lie side-by-side, an arrow-shot apart. Atop it a great fig-tree rises, shaggy with leaves; beneath it awesome Chary bdis gulps the dark water down. Three times a day she vomits it up, three times she gulps it down, that terror! Don't be ^Aere when the whirlpool swallows down — not even the earthquake god could save you from disaster. No, hug Scylla's crag — sail on past her — ^top speed! Better by far to lose six men and keep your ship than lose your entire crew.' 'Yes, yes, but tell me the truth now, goddess,' 1 protested. 'Deadly Charybdis — can't I possibly cut and run from her and still fight Scylla off when Scylla strikes my men?' 'So stubborn!' the lovely goddess countered. 'Hell-bent yet again on battle and feats of arms? Can't you bow to the deathless gods themselves? Scylla's no mortal, she's an immortal devastation, terrible, savage, wild, no fighting her, no defense — just flee the creature, that's the only way. Waste any time, arming for battle beside her rock, 1 fear she'll lunge out again with all of her six heads and seize as many men. No, row for your lives, invoke Brute Force, 1 tell you, Scylla's mother — she spawned her to scourge mankind, she cow stop the monster's next attack! Then you will make the island of Thrinacia ... where herds of the Sungod's cattle graze, and fat sheep and seven herds of oxen, as many sheepflocks, rich and woolly, fifty head in each. No breeding swells their number, nor do they ever die. And goddesses herd them on, nymphs with glinting hair, Phaethousa, Lampetie, born to the Sungod Helios by radiant Neaera. Their queenly mother bred and reared them both, then settled them on the island of Thrinacia — their homeland seas away — to guard their father's sheep and longhorn cattle. Leave the beasts unharmed, your mind set on home, and you a77may still reach Ithaca — bent with hardship, true — but harm them in any way, and 1 can see it now: your ship destroyed, your men destroyed as well! And even if f/f7f/ escape, you'll come home late, all shipmates lost, and come a broken man.' At those words Dawn rose on her golden throne and lustrous Circe made her way back up the island. 1 went straight to my ship, commanding all hands to take to the decks and cast off cables quickly. They swung aboard at once, they sat to the oars in ranks and in rhythm churned the water white with stroke on stroke. And Circe the nymph with glossy braids, the awesome one who speaks with human voice, sent us a hardy shipmate, yes, a fresh following wind ruffling up in our wake, bellying out our sail to drive our blue prow on as we, securing the running gear from stem to stern, sat back while the wind and helmsman kept her true on course. At last, and sore at heart, 1 told my shipmates, 'Friends ... it's wrong for only one or two to know the revelations that lovely Circe made to me alone. I'll tell you all, so we can die with our eyes wide open now or escape our fate and certain death together. First, she warns, we must steer clear of the Sirens, their enchanting song, their meadow starred with flowers. 1 alone was to hear their voices, so she said, but you must bind me with tight chafing ropes so 1 cannot move a muscle, bound to the spot, erect at the mast-block, lashed by ropes to the mast. And if 1 plead, commanding you to set me free, then lash me faster, rope on pressing rope.' So 1 informed my shipmates point by point, all the while our trim ship was speeding toward the Sirens' island, driven on by the brisk wind. But then — ^the wind fell in an instant, all glazed to a dead calm ... a mysterious power hushed the heaving swells. The oarsmen leapt to their feet, struck the sail, stowed it deep in the hold and sat to the oarlocks, thrashing with polished oars, frothing the water white. Now with a sharp sword 1 sliced an ample wheel of beeswax down into pieces, kneaded them in my two strong hands and the wax soon grew soft, worked by my strength and Helios' burning rays, the sun at high noon, and 1 stopped the ears of my comrades one by one. They bound me hand and foot in the tight ship — erect at the mast-block, lashed by ropes to the mast — and rowed and churned the whitecaps stroke on stroke. We were just offshore as far as a man's shout can carry, scudding close, when the Sirens sensed at once a ship was racing past and burst into their high, thrilling song: Come closer, famous Odysseus — ^Achaea's pride and glory — moor your ship on our coast so you can hear our song! Never has any sailor passed our shores in his black craft until he has heard the honeyed voices pouring from our lips, and once he hears to his heart's content sails on, a wiser man. We know all the pains that Achaeans and Trojans once endured on the spreading plain of Troy when the gods willed it so — all that comes to pass on the fertile earth, we know it all!' So they sent their ravishing voices out across the air and the heart inside me throbbed to listen longer. 1 signaled the crew with frowns to set me free — they flung themselves at the oars and rowed on harder, Perimedes and Eurylochus springing up at once to bind me faster with rope on chafing rope. But once we'd left the Sirens fading in our wake, once we could hear their song no more, their urgent call — my steadfast crew was quick to remove the wax I'd used to seal their ears and loosed the bonds that lashed me. We'd scarcely put that island astern when suddenly 1 saw smoke and heavy breakers, heard their booming thunder. The men were terrified — oarblades flew from their grip, clattering down to splash in the vessel's wash. She lay there, dead in the water ... no hands to tug the blades that drove her on. But 1 strode down the decks to rouse my crewmen, halting beside each one with a bracing, winning word: 'Friends, we're hardly strangers at meeting danger — and this danger is no worse than what we faced when Cyclops penned us up in his vaulted cave with crushing force! But even from there my courage, my presence of mind and tactics saved us all. and we will live to remember this someday, 1 have no doubt. Up now, follow my orders, all of us work as one! You men at the thwarts — lay on with your oars and strike the heaving swells, trusting that Zeus will pull us through these straits alive. You, helmsman, here's your order — burn it in your mind — the steering-oar of our rolling ship is in your hands. Keep her clear of that smoke and surging breakers, head for those crags or she'll catch you off guard, she'll yaw over there — you'll plunge us all in ruin!' So 1 shouted. They snapped to each command. No mention of Scylla — how to fight that nightmare? — for fear the men would panic, desert their oars and huddle down and stow themselves away. But now 1 cleared my mind of Circe's orders — cramping my style, urging me not to arm at all. 1 donned my heroic armor, seized long spears in both my hands and marched out on the half-deck, forward, hoping from there to catch the first glimpse of Scylla, ghoul of the cliffs, swooping to kill my men. But nowhere could 1 make her out — and my eyes ached, scanning that mist-bound rock face top to bottom. Now wailing in fear, we rowed on up those straits, Scylla to starboard, dreaded Charybdis off to port, her horrible whirlpool gulping the sea-surge down, down but when she spewed it up — like a cauldron over a raging fire — all her churning depths would seethe and heave — exploding spray showering down to splatter" the peaks of both crags at once! But when she swallowed the sea-surge down her gaping maw the whole abyss lay bare and the rocks around her roared, terrible, deafening — bedrock showed down deep, boiling black with sand — and ashen terror gripped the men. But now, fearing death, all eyes fixed on Charybdis — now Scylla snatched six men from our hollow ship. the toughest, strongest hands I had, and glancing backward over the decks, searching for my crew I could see their hands and feet already hoisted, flailing, high, higher, over my head, look — wailing down at me, comrades riven in agony, shrieking out my name for one last time! Just as an angler poised on a jutting rock flings his treacherous bait in the offshore swell, whips his long rod — hook sheathed in an oxhorn lure — and whisks up little fish he flips on the beach-break, writhing, gasping out their lives ... so now they writhed, gasping as Scylla swung them up her cliff, and there at her cavern's mouth she bolted them down raw — screaming out, flinging their arms toward me, lost in that mortal struggle ... Of all the pitiful things I've had to witness, suffering, searching out the pathways of the sea, this wrenched my heart the most. But now, at last, putting the Rocks, Scylla and dread Charybdis far astern, we quickly reached the good green island of the Sun where Helios, lord Hyperion, keeps his fine cattle, broad in the brow, and flocks of purebred sheep. Still aboard my black ship in the open sea 1 could hear the lowing cattle driven home, the bleating sheep. And 1 was struck once more by the words of the blind Theban prophet, Tiresias, and Aeaean Circe too: time and again they told me to shun this island of the Sun, the joy of man. So 1 warned my shipmates gravely, sick at heart, 'Listen to me, my comrades, brothers in hardship, let me tell you the dire prophecies of Tiresias and Aeaean Circe too: time and again they told me to shun this island of the Sun, the joy of man. Here, they warned, the worst disaster awaits us. Row straight past these shores — race our black ship on!' So I said, and the warnings broke their hearts. But Eurylochus waded in at once — with mutiny on his mind: 'You're a hard man, Odysseus. Your fighting spirit's stronger than ours, your stamina never fails. You must be made of iron head to foot. Look, your crew's half -dead with labor, starved for sleep, and you iorhid us to set foot on land, this island here, washed by the waves, where we might catch a decent meal again. Drained as we are, night falling fast, you'd have us desert this haven and blunder off, into the mist-bound seas? Out of the night come winds that shatter vessels — how can a man escape his headlong death if suddenly, out of nowhere, a cyclone hits, bred by the South or stormy West Wind? They 're the gales that tear a ship to splinters — the gods, our masters, willing or not, it seems. No, let's give way to the dark night, set out our supper here. Sit tight by our swift ship and then at daybreak board and launch her, make for open sea!' So Eurylochus urged, and shipmates cheered. Then 1 knew some power was brewing trouble for us, so 1 let fly with an anxious plea: 'Eurylochus, I'm one against all — the upper hand is yours. But swear me a binding oath, all here, that if we come on a herd of cattle or fine flock of sheep, not one man among us — blind in his reckless ways — will slaughter an ox or ram. Just eat in peace, content with the food immortal Circe gave us.' They quickly swore the oath that 1 required and once they had vowed they 'd never harm the herds, they moored our sturdy ship in the deep narrow harbor, close to a fresh spring, and all hands disembarked and adeptly set about the evening meal. Once they 'd put aside desire for food and drink, they recalled our dear companions, wept for the men that Scylla plucked from the hollow ship and ate alive, and a welcome sleep came on them in their tears. But then, at the night's third watch, the stars just wheeling down, Zeus who marshals the stormclouds loosed a ripping wind, a howling, demonic gale, shrouding over in thunderheads the earth and sea at once — and night swept down from the sky. When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more we hauled our craft ashore, securing her in a vaulted cave where nymphs have lovely dancing-rings and hold their sessions. There 1 called a muster, warning my shipmates yet again, 'Friends, we've food and drink aplenty aboard the ship — keep hands off all these herds or we will pay the price! The cattle, the sleek flocks, belong to an awesome master, Helios, god of the sun who sees all, hears all things.' So 1 warned, and my headstrong men complied. But for one whole month the South Wind blew nonstop, no other wind came up, none but the South, Southeast. As long as our food and ruddy wine held out, the crew, eager to save their lives, kept hands off the herds. But then, when supplies aboard had all run dry, when the men turned to hunting, forced to range for quarry with twisted hooks: for fish, birds, anything they could lay their hands on — hunger racked their bellies — 1 struck inland, up the island, there to pray to the gods. If only one might show me some way home! Crossing into the heartland, clear of the crew, 1 rinsed my hands in a sheltered spot, a windbreak, but soon as I'd prayed to all the gods who rule Olympus, down on my eyes they poured a sweet, sound sleep ... as Eury lochus opened up his fatal plan to friends: 'Listen to me, my comrades, brothers in hardship. All ways of dying are hateful to us poor mortals, true, but to die of hunger, starve to death — that's the worst of all. So up with you now, let's drive off the pick of Helios' sleek herds, slaughter them to the gods who rule the skies up there. If we ever make it home to Ithaca, native ground. erect at once a glorious temple to the Sungod, line the walls with hoards of dazzling gifts! But if the Sun, inflamed for his longhorn cattle, means to wreck our ship and the other gods pitch in — I'd rather die at sea, with one deep gulp of death, than die by inches on this desolate island here!' So he urged, and shipmates cheered again. At once they drove off the Sungod s finest cattle — close at hand, not far from the blue-prowed ship they grazed, those splendid beasts with their broad brows and curving horns. Surrounding them in a ring, they lifted prayers to the gods, plucking fresh green leaves from a tall oak for the rite, since white strewing-barley was long gone in the ship. Once they'd prayed, slaughtered and skinned the cattle, they cut the thighbones out, they wrapped them round in fat, a double fold sliced clean and topped with strips of flesh. And since they had no wine to anoint the glowing victims, they made libations with water, broiling all the innards, and once they'd burned the bones and tasted the organs — hacked the rest into pieces, piercing them with spits. That moment soothing slumber fell from my eyes and down 1 went to our ship at the water's edge but on my way, nearing the long beaked craft, the smoky savor of roasts came floating up around me ... 1 groaned in anguish, crying out to the deathless gods: 'Father Zeus! the rest of you blissful gods who never die — you with your fatal sleep, you lulled me into disaster. Left on their own, look what a monstrous thing my crew concocted!' Quick as a flash with her flaring robes Lampetie sped the news to the Sun on high that we had killed his herds, and Helios burst out in rage to all the immortals: 'Father Zeus! the rest of you blissful gods who never die — punish them all, that crew of Laertes' son Odysseus — what an outrage! They, they killed my cattle. the great joy of my heart ... day in, day out, when I climbed the starry skies and when I wheeled back down from the heights to touch the earth once more. Unless they pay me back in blood for the butchery of my herds, down 1 go to the House of Death and blaze among the dead!' But Zeus who marshals the thunderheads insisted. Sun, you keep on shining among the deathless gods and mortal men across the good green earth. And as for the guilty ones, why, soon enough on the wine-dark sea I'll hit their racing ship with a white-hot bolt, I'll tear it into splinters.' — Or so 1 heard from the lovely nymph Calypso, who heard it herself, she said, from Hermes, god of guides. As soon as 1 reached our ship at the water's edge 1 took the men to task, upbraiding each in turn, but how to set things right? We couldn't find a way. The cattle were dead already ... and the gods soon showed us all some fateful signs — the hides began to crawl, the meat, both raw and roasted, bellowed out on the spits, and we heard a noise like the moan of lowing oxen. Yet six more days my eager companions feasted on the cattle of the Sun, the pick of the herds they'd driven off, but then, when Cronian Zeus brought on the seventh day, the wind in its ceaseless raging dropped at last, and stepping the mast at once, hoisting the white sail we boarded ship and launched her, made for open sea. But once we'd left that island in our wake — no land at all in sight, nothing but sea and sky — then Zeus the son of Cronus mounted a thunderhead above our hollow ship and the deep went black beneath it. Nor did the craft scud on much longer. All of a sudden killer-squalls attacked us, screaming out of the west. a murderous blast shearing the two forestays off so the mast toppled backward, its running tackle spilling into the bilge. The mast itself went crashing into the stern, it struck the helmsman's head and crushed his skull to pulp and down from his deck the man flipped like a diver — his hardy life spirit left his bones behind. Then, then in the same breath Zeus hit the craft with a lightning-bolt and thunder. Round she spun, reeling under the impact, filled with reeking brimstone, shipmates pitching out of her, bobbing round like seahawks swept along by the whitecaps past the trim black hull — and the god cut short their journey home forever. But 1 went lurching along our battered hulk till the sea-surge ripped the plankings from the keel and the waves swirled it away, stripped bare, and snapped the mast from the decks — but a backstay made of buU's-hide still held fast, and with this 1 lashed the mast and keel together, made them one, riding my makeshift raft as the wretched galewinds bore me on and on. At last the West Wind quit its wild rage but the South came on at once to hound me even more, making me double back my route toward cruel Charybdis. All night long 1 was rushed back, and then at break of day 1 reached the crag of Scylla and dire Charybdis' vortex right when the dreadful whirlpool gulped the salt sea down. But heaving myself aloft to clutch at the fig-tree's height, like a bat 1 clung to its trunk for dear life — not a chance for a good firm foothold there, no clambering up it either, the roots too far to reach, the boughs too high overhead, huge swaying branches that overshadowed Charybdis. But 1 held on, dead set ... waiting for her to vomit my mast and keel back up again — Oh how 1 ached for both! and back they came, late but at last, at just the hour a judge at court, who's settled the countless suits of brash young claimants, rises, the day 's work done, and turns home for supper — that's when the timbers reared back up from Charybdis. I let go — I plunged with my hands and feet flailing, crashing into the waves beside those great beams and scrambling aboard them fast 1 rowed hard with my hands right through the straits ... And the father of men and gods did not let Scylla see me, else I'd have died on the spot — no escape from death. 1 drifted along nine days. On the tenth, at night, the gods cast me up on Ogygia, Calypso's island, home of the dangerous nymph with glossy braids who speaks with human voice, and she took me in, she loved me ... Why cover the same ground again? Just yesterday, here at hall, 1 told you all the rest, you and your gracious wife. It goes against my grain to repeat a tale told once, and told so clearly."
